0,HJWHIKqgl,Accept (Poster),Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy,"We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). This optimized MMD is applied to the setting of unsupervised learning by generative adversarial networks (GAN), in which a model attempts to generate realistic samples, and a discriminator attempts to tell these apart from data samples. In this context, the MMD may be used in two roles: first, as a discriminator, either directly on the samples, or on features of the samples. Second, the MMD can be used to evaluate the performance of a generative model, by testing the model’s samples against a reference data set. In the latter role, the optimized MMD is particularly helpful, as it gives an interpretable indication of how the model and data distributions differ, even in cases where individual model samples are not easily distinguished either by eye or by classifier.",['Unsupervised Learning'],"This paper presents two ways that MMDs can be used to aid the GAN training framework. The relation to current literature is clearly explained, and the paper has illuminating side-experiments. The main con is that it's not clear if MMD-based training will be competitive in the long run with more flexible, but harder-to-use, neural network based approaches. However, this paper gives us a conceptual framework to evaluate new proposals for related GAN training procedures."
1,SyK00v5xx,Accept (Poster),A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings,"
The success of neural network methods for computing word embeddings has motivated methods for generating semantic embeddings of longer pieces of text, such as sentences and paragraphs. Surprisingly, Wieting et al (ICLR'16) showed that such complicated methods are outperformed, especially in out-of-domain (transfer learning) settings, by simpler methods involving mild retraining of word embeddings and basic linear regression. The  method of Wieting et al. requires retraining with a substantial labeled dataset such as Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). 

The current paper goes further, showing that the following completely unsupervised sentence embedding is a formidable baseline: Use word embeddings computed using one of the popular methods on unlabeled corpus like Wikipedia, represent the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors, and then modify them a bit using PCA/SVD. This weighting improves performance by about 10% to 30% in textual similarity tasks, and beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. It even improves Wieting et al.'s embeddings. 
 This simple method should be used as the baseline to beat in future, especially when labeled training data is scarce or nonexistent. 

The paper also gives a theoretical explanation of the success of the above unsupervised method using a latent variable generative model for sentences, which is a simple extension of the model in Arora et al. (TACL'16) with new ""smoothing"" terms that allow for 
words occurring out of context, as well as high probabilities for words like and, not in all contexts. ","['Natural language processing', 'Unsupervised Learning']",A new method for sentence embedding that is simple and performs well.

2,Hkg4TI9xl,Accept (Poster),A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks,"We consider the two related problems of detecting if an example is misclassified or out-of-distribution. We present a simple baseline that utilizes probabilities from softmax distributions. Correctly classified examples tend to have greater maximum softmax probabilities than erroneously classified and out-of-distribution examples, allowing for their detection. We assess performance by defining several tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition, showing the effectiveness of this baseline across all. We then show the baseline can sometimes be surpassed, demonstrating the room for future research on these underexplored detection tasks.",['Computer vision'],"The paper presents an approach that uses the statistics of softmax outputs to identify misclassifications and/or outliers.

This new dataset is aimed to overcome a number of well-known weaknesses of previous publicly available datasets for the same task of reading comprehension and question answering. In MS MARCO, all questions are sampled from real anonymized user queries. The context passages, from which answers in the dataset are derived, are extracted from real web documents using the most advanced version of the Bing search engine. The answers to the queries are human generated. Finally, a subset of these queries has multiple answers. We aim to release one million queries and the corresponding answers in the dataset, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most comprehensive real-world dataset of its kind in both quantity and quality. We are currently releasing 100,000 queries with their corresponding answers to inspire work in reading comprehension and question answering along with gathering feedback from the research community.",[],"Though the dataset is likely to have a large impact on the community, there is a general consensus among the reviewers that the authors could have done a better job characterizing the dataset (lack discussion on answer types, careful comparison with previous datasets, human performance on the dataset).

4,H178hw9ex,Reject,Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks,"Filters in a convolutional network are typically parametrized in a pixel basis. As an orthonormal basis, pixels may represent any arbitrary vector in Rn. In this paper, we relax this orthonormality requirement and extend the set of viable bases to the generalized notion of frames. When applying suitable frame bases to ResNets on Cifar-10+ we demonstrate improved error rates by substitution only. By exploiting the transformation properties of such generalized bases, we arrive at steerable frames, that allow to continuously transform CNN filters under arbitrary Lie-groups. Further allowing us to locally separate pose from canonical appearance. We implement this in the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network, that dynamically estimates the transformations of filters, conditioned on its input. The derived method presents a hybrid of Dynamic Filter Networks and Spatial Transformer Networks that can be implemented in any convolutional architecture, as we illustrate in two examples. First, we illustrate estimation properties of steerable frames with a Dynamic Steerable Frame Network, compared to a Dynamic Filter Network on the task of edge detection, where we show clear advantages of the derived steerable frames. Lastly, we insert the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network as a module in a convolutional LSTM on the task of limited-data hand-gesture recognition from video and illustrate effective dynamic regularization and show clear advantages over Spatial Transformer Networks. In this paper, we have laid out the foundations of Frame-based convolutional networks and Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks while illustrating their advantages for continuously transforming features and data-efficient learning.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning']","This paper studies how to incorporate local invariance to geometric transformations into a CNN pipeline. It proposes steerable filter banks as the ground-bed to measure and produce such local invariance, building on previous work from the same authors as well as the Spatial Transformer Networks. Preliminary experiments on several tasks requiring different levels of local invariance are presented. 
 
 The reviewers had varying opinions about this work; all acknowledged the potential benefits of the approach, while some of them raised questions about the significance and usefulness of the approach. The authors were very responsive during the rebuttal phase and took into account all the feedback. 
 
 Based on the technical content of the paper and the reviewers opinion, the AC recommends rejection. Since this decision is not consensual among all reviewers, please let me explain it in more detail.
 
 - The current manuscript does not provide a clear description of the new model in the context of the related works it builds upon (the so-called dynamic filter networks and the spatial transformer networks). The paper spends almost 4 pages with a technical exposition on steerable frames, covering basic material from signal processing. While this might indeed be a good introduction to readers not familiar with the concept of steerable filters, the fact is that it obfuscates the real contributions of the paper. which are not clearly stated. In fact, the model is presented between equations (10) and (11), but it is not clear from these equations what specifically differentiates the dsfn from the other two models -- the reader has to do some digging in order to uncover the differences (which are important). 
 
 Besides this clarity issue, the paper does not offer any insight as to how the 'Pose generating network' Psi is supposed to estimate the pose parameters. Which architecture? what is the underlying estimation problem it is trying to solve, and why do we expect this problem to be efficiently estimated with a neural network? when are the pose parameters uniquely determined? how does this network deal with the aperture effects (i.e. the situations where there is no unicity in determining a specific pose) ?
 Currently, the reader has no access to these questions, which are to some extent at the core of the proposed technique."
5,S1TER2oll,Accept (Poster),FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs. An important property of CNN is its restriction to local connections and sharing of local weights among different locations. In this paper, we consider the definition of appropriate local neighborhoods in CNN. We provide a theoretical analysis that justifies the traditional square filter used in CNN for analyzing natural images. The analysis also provides a principle for designing customized filter shapes for application domains that do not resemble natural images. We propose an approach that automatically designs multiple layers of different customized filter shapes by repeatedly solving lasso problems. It is applied to customize the filter shape for both bioacoustic applications and gene sequence analysis applications. In those domains with small sample sizes we demonstrate that the customized filters achieve superior classification accuracy, improved convergence behavior in training and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters.",[],"Using covariance analysis for designing convolution connection structure is a nice and novel idea.

6,SywUHFcge,Invite to Workshop Track, A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Samples,"Most machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Such inputs are typically generated by adding small but purposeful modifications that lead to incorrect outputs while imperceptible to human eyes. The goal of this paper is not to introduce a single method, but to make theoretical steps toward fully understanding adversarial examples. By using concepts from topology, our theoretical analysis brings forth the key reasons why an adversarial example can fool a classifier ($f_1$) and adds its oracle ($f_2$, like human eyes) in such analysis. 
By investigating the topological relationship between two (pseudo)metric spaces corresponding to predictor $f_1$ and oracle $f_2$, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions that can determine if $f_1$ is always robust (strong-robust) against adversarial examples according to $f_2$. Interestingly our theorems indicate that just one unnecessary feature can make $f_1$ not strong-robust, and the right feature representation learning is the key to getting a classifier that is both accurate and strong robust.

7,B1Igu2ogg,Accept (Poster),Efficient Vector Representation for Documents through Corruption,"We present an efficient document representation learning framework, Document Vector through Corruption (Doc2VecC). Doc2VecC represents each document as a simple average of word embeddings. It ensures a representation generated as such captures the semantic meanings of the document during learning. A corruption model is included, which introduces a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing the embeddings of common and non-discriminative ones to be close to zero. Doc2VecC produces significantly better word embeddings than Word2Vec. We compare Doc2VecC with several state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms. The simple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the state-of-the-art in generating high-quality document representations for sentiment analysis, document classification as well as semantic relatedness tasks. The simplicity of the model enables training on billions of words per hour on a single machine. At the same time, the model is very efficient in generating representations of unseen documents at test time.

 + efficient
 
 Cons:
 + individual ideas are not so novel

8,r1X3g2_xl,Accept (Poster),Adversarial Training Methods for Semi-Supervised Text Classification,"Adversarial training provides a means of regularizing supervised learning algorithms while virtual adversarial training is able to extend supervised learning algorithms to the semi-supervised setting.
However, both methods require making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector, which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot word representations.
We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent neural network rather than to the original input itself.
The proposed method achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and purely supervised tasks.
We provide visualizations and analysis showing that the learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training, the model is less prone to overfitting.
","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning', 'Semi-Supervised Learning']","This paper is concerned with extending adversarial and virtual adversarial training to text classification tasks.

Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines.

10,rkEFLFqee,Accept (Poster),Decomposing Motion and Content for Natural Video Sequence Prediction,"We propose a deep neural network for the prediction of future frames in natural video sequences. To effectively handle complex evolution of pixels in videos, we propose to decompose the motion and content, two key components generating dynamics in videos. Our model is built upon the Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional LSTM for pixel-level prediction, which independently capture the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content, predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features into the next frame content by the identified motion features, which simplifies the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time steps, and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate training. We evaluate the pro- posed network architecture on human activity videos using KTH, Weizmann action, and UCF-101 datasets. We show state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end trainable network architecture with motion and content separation to model the spatio-temporal dynamics for pixel-level future prediction in natural videos.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","Here is a summary of the reviews and discussion:

11,H1acq85gx,Accept (Poster),Maximum Entropy Flow Networks,"Maximum entropy modeling is a flexible and popular framework for formulating statistical models given partial knowledge. In this paper, rather than the traditional method of optimizing over the continuous density directly, we learn a smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution to the desired maximum entropy distribution. Doing so is nontrivial in that the objective being maximized (entropy) is a function of the density itself.  By exploiting recent developments in normalizing flow networks, we cast the maximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization, and solve the problem by combining stochastic optimization with the augmented Lagrangian method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and applications to finance and computer vision show the flexibility and accuracy of using maximum entropy flow networks.",[],"This paper is an interesting application to maximum entropy problems, which are not widely considered in deep learning. The reviewers have concerns over the novelty of this method and the ultimate applicability and scope of these methods.

We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned beta > 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.",[],"This paper proposes a modification of the variational ELBO in encourage 'disentangled' representations, and proposes a measure of disentanglement.

This however, conflicts with their computationally, memory and energy intense nature, leading to a growing interest in compression.
Recent work by Han et al. (2016) propose a pipeline that involves retraining, pruning and quantization of neural network weights, obtaining state-of-the-art compression rates.
In this paper, we show that competitive compression rates can be achieved by using a version of ""soft weight-sharing"" (Nowlan & Hinton, 1991). Our method achieves both quantization and pruning in one simple (re-)training procedure.

14,HkljfjFee,Accept (Poster),Support Regularized Sparse Coding and Its Fast Encoder,"Sparse coding represents a signal by a linear combination of only a few atoms of a learned over-complete dictionary. While sparse coding exhibits compelling performance for various machine learning tasks, the process of obtaining sparse code with fixed dictionary is independent for each data point without considering the geometric information and manifold structure of the entire data. We propose Support Regularized Sparse Coding (SRSC) which produces sparse codes that account for the manifold structure of the data by encouraging nearby data in the manifold to choose similar dictionary atoms. In this way, the obtained support regularized sparse codes capture the locally linear structure of the data manifold and enjoy robustness to data noise. We present the optimization algorithm of SRSC with theoretical guarantee for the optimization over the sparse codes. We also propose a feed-forward neural network termed Deep Support Regularized Sparse Coding (Deep-SRSC) as a fast encoder to approximate the sparse codes generated by SRSC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRSC and Deep-SRSC.",[],"Adding a manifold regularizer to a learning objective function is certainly not a new direction. The paper argues that using a support based regularizer is superior to using a standard graph Laplacian regularizer (which has been explored before), although this argument is not developed particularly rigorously and dominantly has to fall back on empirical evidence. The main contribution of the paper appears to be theoretical justification of an alternating optimization scheme for minimizing the resulting objective function (yet the optimization aspects of dealing with a sparse support regularizer are somewhat orthogonal to the current context). The empirical results are not very convincing since the dictionary size is relatively large compared to the dataset size; the gains with respect to l2 manifold regularizer are not consistent; and the gains using deep architectures to directly predict sparse codes are also modest and somewhat inconsistent. These points aside, the reviewers are overall enthusiastic about the paper and find it to be well written and complete."
15,B1oK8aoxe,Accept (Poster),Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in downstream tasks.
Our approach brings together some of the strengths of intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","The authors provide an approach to policy learning skills via a stochastic neural network representation.

 Pros:
 + Conceptually nice approach to skill learning in RL
 + Strong results on benchmark tasks
 
 Cons:
 - The overall clarity of the paper could still be improved: the actual algorithmic section seems to present the methods still at a very high level, though code release may also help with this (it would not be at all trivial to re-implement the method just given the paper).

However, vanilla online variants are on-policy only and not able to take advantage of off-policy data. In this paper we describe a new technique that combines policy gradient with off-policy Q-learning, drawing experience from a replay buffer. This is motivated by making a connection between the fixed points of the regularized policy gradient algorithm and the Q-values. This connection allows us to estimate the Q-values from the action preferences of the policy, to which we apply Q-learning updates. We refer to the new technique as ‘PGQL’, for policy gradient and Q-learning. We also establish an equivalency between action-value fitting techniques and actor-critic algorithms, showing that regularized policy gradient techniques can be interpreted as advantage function learning algorithms. We conclude with some numerical examples that demonstrate improved data efficiency and stability of PGQL. In particular, we tested PGQL on the full suite of Atari games and achieved performance exceeding that of both asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and Q-learning.

This passive learning is problematic if we are in- terested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communi- cation. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message to the receiver, while the receiver must rely on it to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore whether the “word meanings” induced in the game reflect intuitive semantic properties of the objects depicted in the image, and we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents’ code into natural language, a necessary step in developing machines that should eventually be able to communicate with humans.

20,HkNRsU5ge,Accept (Poster),Sigma Delta Quantized Networks,"Deep neural networks can be obscenely wasteful. When processing video, a convolutional network expends a fixed amount of computation for each frame with no regard to the similarity between neighbouring frames. As a result, it ends up repeatedly doing very similar computations. To put an end to such waste, we introduce Sigma-Delta networks. With each new input, each layer in this network sends a discretized form of its change in activation to the next layer. Thus the amount of computation that the network does scales with the amount of change in the input and layer activations, rather than the size of the network. We introduce an optimization method for converting any pre-trained deep network into an optimally efficient Sigma-Delta network, and show that our algorithm, if run on the appropriate hardware, could cut at least an order of magnitude from the computational cost of processing video data.

These models, however, are usually much less suited for semi-supervised problems because of their tendency to overfit easily when trained on small amounts of data. In this work we will explore a new training objective that is targeting a semi-supervised regime with only a small subset of labeled data. This criterion is based on a deep metric embedding over distance relations within the set of labeled samples, together with constraints over the embeddings of the unlabeled set.

In particular, this seems to be the *proper* way to perform semi-supervised learning. 
 However, the model appears extremely similar to [Grandvalet & Bengio, '04], not just in the entropy-minimization regularization for unlabeled examples, but also for the cross-entropy minimization of labeled examples and the semi-supervised objective. The only difference I perceive is that [G & B '04] present a generic recognition model p( z | x), whereas the present submission uses a classification layer of the form 
 (1) p(z | x ) = softmax( -|| Phi(x) - Phi(y_k) ||^2 ), 
 where the y_k are randomly chosen examples of class respectively k. p(z | x) is thus random relative to the choice of 'anchors' y_k. 
 Thus, the present model is rather a particular case, unless I misunderstood. In that case, the main question is to understand how much the excellent numerical performance relies on this particular choice of classification layer. The numerical section should consider a baseline where (1) is replaced by a 'standard' classification softmax of the form p(z | x ) = softmax( < v_k, Phi(x) > ), where v_k are class-specific parameters. 
 
 For these reasons,we recommend inviting this submission to the workshop track, and we encourage the authors to address the previous remark."
22,BJtNZAFgg,Accept (Poster),Adversarial Feature Learning,"The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing generators learn to ""linearize semantics"" in the latent space of such models. Intuitively, such latent spaces may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.",[],"All reviewers unanimously praised the novelty and quality of the paper.

23,r1YNw6sxg,Accept (Poster),Learning Visual Servoing with Deep Features and Fitted Q-Iteration,"Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the world. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

End- to-end dialog systems, in which all components are trained from the dialogs themselves, escape this limitation. But the encouraging success recently obtained in chit-chat dialog may not carry over to goal-oriented settings. This paper proposes a testbed to break down the strengths and shortcomings of end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. Set in the context of restaurant reservation, our tasks require manipulating sentences and symbols, so as to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputs of such calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks can reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to perform non-trivial operations. We confirm those results by comparing our system to a hand-crafted slot-filling baseline on data from the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (Henderson et al., 2014a). We show similar result patterns on data extracted from an online concierge service.",[],"Most dialog systems are based on chit-chat models.

In this work I introduce the Gated Graph Transformer Neural Network (GGT-NN), an extension of GGS-NNs that uses graph-structured data as an intermediate representation. The model can learn to construct and modify graphs in sophisticated ways based on textual input, and also to use the graphs to produce a variety of outputs. For example, the model successfully learns to solve almost all of the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2016), and also discovers the rules governing graphical formulations of a simple cellular automaton and a family of Turing machines.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning', 'Structured prediction']","The idea of building a graph-based differentiable memory is very good.

26,SJkXfE5xx,Accept (Poster),Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests,"The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \sim P^n$ and $S_Q \sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution.  Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis ``$P = Q$'' is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level.  As we will show, such \emph{Classifier Two-Sample Tests} (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ.

The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST.  First, we analyze their main theoretical properties.  Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives.  Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery.","['Theory', 'Unsupervised Learning']",The reviewers agree that the paper is a valuable contribution to the literature.

In this paper, we attack the problem of optimization of highly non-convex neural networks objectives by starting with a smoothed -- or mollified -- objective function which becomes more complex as the training proceeds.  Our proposition is inspired by the recent studies in continuation methods: similarly to curriculum methods, we begin by learning an easier (possibly convex) objective function and let it evolve during training until it eventually becomes the original, difficult to optimize objective function. The complexity of the mollified networks is controlled by a single hyperparameter that is annealed during training. We show improvements on various difficult optimization tasks and establish a relationship between recent works on continuation methods for neural networks and mollifiers.
","['Deep learning', 'Optimization']","The paper presents a nice idea for using a sequence of progressively more expressive neural networks to train a model. Experiments are shown on CIFAR10, parity, language modeling to show that the methods performs well on these tasks.
 However, as noted by the reviewers, the experiments do not do a convincing enough job. For example, the point of the model is to show that optimization can be made easier by their concept, however, results are presented on depths that are considered shallow these days. The results on PTB are also very far from SOTA. However, because of the novelty of the idea, and because of the authors ratings, I'm giving the paper a pass. I strongly encourage the authors to revise the paper accordingly for the camera ready version.

In spite of their great success in terms of accuracy, their large training time makes it difficult to use them for various tasks. In this paper, we explore the idea of learning weight evolution pattern from a simple network for accelerating training of novel neural networks.

We use a neural network to learn the training pattern from MNIST classification and utilize it to accelerate training of neural networks used for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification.

29,HJjiFK5gx,Accept (Poster),Neural Program Lattices,"We propose the Neural Program Lattice (NPL), a neural network that learns to perform complex tasks by composing low-level programs to express high-level programs. Our starting point is the recent work on Neural Programmer-Interpreters (NPI), which can only learn from strong supervision that contains the whole hierarchy of low-level and high-level programs. NPLs remove this limitation by providing the ability to learn from weak supervision consisting only of sequences of low-level operations. We demonstrate the capability of NPL to learn to perform long-hand addition and arrange blocks in a grid-world environment. Experiments show that it performs on par with NPI while using weak supervision in place of most of the strong supervision, thus indicating its ability to infer the high-level program structure from examples containing only the low-level operations.","['Deep learning', 'Semi-Supervised Learning']","This paper demonstrates a novel (although somewhat obvious) extension to NPI, namely moving away from training exclusively on full traces (in order to model the nested calling of subprograms) to training, in part on low-level program traces. By exploiting a continuous stack in the vein of Das et al. 1992, Joulin and Mikolov 2015, or Grefenstette et al. 2015 (any of which could plausibly have been used here, by my reading, contrary to claims made by the authors in discussion), they can model nested calls with a stack-like structure which needs only partial supervision of a few full traces. The claim is that the resulting model is more sample efficient than the NPI of Reed and de Freitas.
 
 The reviews are mixed. R1 is grumpy about citations, which I see as grounds for rejection, but raises the point that the claims to data efficiency may be overblown since it is only shown that few full traces are needed to train the model, not that it can infer structure without full traces, which would be more impressive. Confusingly, they refer to continuous stacks as probabilistic, which is misleading as while there is (in all variants mentioned above) a possible probabilistic interpretation of non-{0, 1} push/pop operations, the updates to the stack state are deterministic, as are all other aspects of the network except test-time sampling of actions from the multivariate distribution induced by the softmax on output.
 
 R2 has not understood the paper or background material if they mistakenly believe that the stack-like structure and resulting model are probabilistic, as there is no sampling of actions on the stack, but only deterministic state updates. The superficiality of the review combined with the fairly crucial misunderstanding sadly means I cannot rely on it to make a recommendation.
 
 R3 is broadly sympathetic to the paper, while recognising that it still requires information about the program structure through partial FULL supervision in order to learn to manipulate the continuous stack (and thus nested function calls). It is disappointing that the authors did not reply to this point in this review. I acknowledge that they address this claim in part in a response to R1, but the reply is mostly that they will rewrite the formulation of their claims.
 
 Overall, the novelty of this paper lies in the integration of an existing flavour of differentiable data structure, variants of which have recently been presented at NIPS in 2015, into NPI in order to learn program structure. This would have made for an excellent paper if this augmentation had shown that, without partial supervision on the stack operations (thus training solely from low level traces) the model had been able to infer program structures. The need to provide some full traces is disappointing in this respect, although the claim about providing a more data-efficient training regime thanks to the data structure is plausible. 

Stil, overall, the PCs encourage the authors to address the remainig issues in the camera reasy version of their paper and to present this as a poster at the main conference."

While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for their success, there are indications that these architectures defy a popular view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract features at each layer.

In this report, we argue that this view is incomplete and does not adequately explain several recent findings.
We propose an alternative viewpoint based on unrolled iterative estimation---a group of successive layers iteratively refine their estimates of the same features instead of computing an entirely new representation.
We demonstrate that this viewpoint directly leads to the construction of highway and residual networks. 
Finally we provide preliminary experiments to discuss the similarities and differences between the two architectures.","['Theory', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","The paper provides interesting new interpretations of highway and residual networks, which should be of great interest to the community."

SQuAD provides a challenging testbed for evaluating machine comprehension algorithms, partly because compared with previous datasets, in SQuAD the answers do not come from a small set of candidate answers and they have variable lengths.

Other than f, the training data is unsupervised and consist of a set of samples from each domain, without any mapping between them. The Domain Transfer Network (DTN) we present employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f preserving component, and a regularizing component that encourages G to map samples from T to themselves. We apply our method to visual domains including digits and face images and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities, while preserving their identity.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Transfer Learning']","The authors propose a application of GANs to map images to new domains with no labels.

This causes inefficiencies in learning both in terms of utilizing all of the information and in terms of the number of parameters needed to train. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that facilitates better learning in language modeling, and show that our framework leads to tying together the input embedding and the output projection matrices, greatly reducing the number of trainable variables.

 - The ""theoretical justification"" for coupling of the input and output layers is based on the premise that the above regularization is the correct thing to do. Since that's really not justified by some kind of theory, I think its questionable to call this simple observation a theoretical justification.

Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult to reason about the behavior of these models beyond a certain level of input complexity. In order to address these issues, we propose augmenting neural architectures with a key abstraction: recursion. As an application, we implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts of training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and drastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system’s behavior.

However, given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge, such as knowing the overall recursive structure of a sequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely use arithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neural implementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers can write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data and better generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neural program optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching that lead to significant speed improvements.

We investigate how a learner can benefit from asking questions in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings, and demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions. Our work represents a first step in developing such end-to-end learned interactive dialogue agents.

Paper introduces a simulator and synthetic question answering task where interactions with the teacher are used for learning.

46,B16dGcqlx,Accept (Poster),Third Person Imitation Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achieving
sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in
reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize.
Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to overcome this problem.
Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend to require that demonstrations
are supplied in the first-person: the agent is provided with a sequence of
states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful,
this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting
first-person demonstrations. Humans address this problem by learning from
third-person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the
task, and accomplish the same task themselves.
In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation learning.
Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a simple
goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher
achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and unsupervised refers
to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person demonstrations, and is
not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states. Our
methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain confusion can be
utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial during the training
process. To validate our approach, we report successful experiments on learning
from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain, a reacher domain, and
inverted pendulum.",[],"pros:

47,S1jE5L5gl,Accept (Poster),The Concrete Distribution: A Continuous Relaxation of Discrete Random Variables,"The reparameterization trick enables optimizing large scale stochastic computation graphs via gradient descent. The essence of the trick is to refactor each stochastic node into a differentiable function of its parameters and a random variable with fixed distribution. After refactoring, the gradients of the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack useful reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce Concrete random variables -- continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The Concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, Concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-probability of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Concrete relaxations on density estimation and structured prediction tasks using neural networks.

We interleave greedy criteria-based pruning with fine-tuning by backpropagation-a computationally efficient procedure that maintains good generalization in the pruned network. We propose a new criterion based on Taylor expansion that approximates the change in the cost function induced by pruning network parameters. We focus on transfer learning, where large pretrained networks are adapted to specialized tasks. The proposed criterion demonstrates superior performance compared to other criteria, e.g. the norm of kernel weights or feature map activation, for pruning large CNNs after adaptation to fine-grained classification tasks (Birds-200 and Flowers-102) relaying only on the first order gradient information. We also show that pruning can lead to more than 10x theoretical reduction in adapted 3D-convolutional filters with a small drop in accuracy in a recurrent gesture classifier. Finally, we show results for the large-scale ImageNet dataset to emphasize the flexibility of our approach.","['Deep learning', 'Transfer Learning']",The paper presents a method for pruning filters from convolutional neural networks based on the first order Taylor expansion of the loss change.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to generating adaptive spatiotemporal representations  of videos for a captioning task.  For this purpose, novel attention mechanisms with spatiotemporal alignment is employed to adaptively and sequentially focus on different layers of CNN features (levels of feature ``abstraction''), as well as local spatiotemporal regions of the feature maps at each layer. Our approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets: YouTube2Text, M-VAD and MSR-VTT.  Along with visualizing the results and how the model works, these experiments quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive spatiotemporal feature abstraction for translating videos to sentences with rich semantics.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning']","Reviewers feel the work is well executed and that the model makes sense, but two of the reviewers were not convinced that the proposed method contains enough novelty in light of prior work. The comparison of the soft vs hard attention model variations is perhaps one of the more novel aspects of the work; however, the degree of novelty within these formulations and the insights obtained from their comparison were not perceived as being enough to warrant higher ratings.

The network has a discriminative part (classifying actions) and a generative part (predicting motion), whose recurrent cells are laterally connected, allowing higher levels of the network to represent high level behavioral phenomena. We test our framework on two types of tracking data, fruit fly behavior and online handwriting. Our results show that 1) taking advantage of unlabeled sequences, by predicting future motion, significantly improves action detection performance when training labels are scarce, 2) the network learns to represent high level phenomena such as writer identity and fly gender, without supervision, and 3) simulated motion trajectories, generated by treating motion prediction as input to the network, look realistic and may be used to qualitatively evaluate whether the model has learnt generative control rules.

  The paper develops a recurrently coupled discriminative / generative hierarchical model, as applied to fruit-fly behavior and online handwriting. Qualitative evaluation is provided by generating motions, in addition to quantitative results. Writer identity and fly gender are learned in an unsupervised fashion.

51,ryHlUtqge,Accept (Poster),Generalizing Skills with Semi-Supervised Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire complex behaviors from low-level inputs, such as images. However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while it is deployed and performing useful tasks. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, to tell the agent whether it is succeeding or failing at its task. Such reward functions are often hard to measure in the real world, especially in domains such as robotics and dialog systems, where the reward could depend on the unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. On the other hand, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present, or in a controlled laboratory setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect in the unstructured real world? In this paper, we formalize this problem setting as semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of “labeled” MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of “unlabeled” MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent’s own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging, continuous control tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available. We also show that our method outperforms direct supervised learning of the reward.",['Reinforcement Learning'],"This paper provides an interesting framework for handling semi-supervised RL problems, settings were one can interact with many MDPs drawn from some class, but where only a few have observable rewards; the agent then uses a policy derived from the labeled MDPs to estimate a reward function for the unlabeled MDPs. The approach is straightforward, and one reviewer raises the reasonable concern that this seems to be a fairly narrow definition and approach to the universe of things that could be thought of as semi-supervised reinforcement learning (elements like Laplacian value functions, e.g. proto value functions, for instance, present a very different take on could what also be considered semi-supervised RL).
 
 Overall, however, the main benefit of this paper is that the overall idea here is quite compelling. Even if it's a narrow view on semisupervised RL, it nonetheless is clearly thinking more broadly about skill and data efficiency than what is common in many current RL papers. Given this impressive scope, plus good performance (if only on a relatively small set of benchmarks), it seems like this paper is certainly above bar for acceptance.
 
 Pros:
 + Nice introduction of a new/modified semisupervised reinforce setting
 + Results on benchmarks look compelling (if still fairly small scale)
 
 Cons:
 - Rather limited view of the space of all possible semisupervised Rl
 - Results on hardest task (half-cheetah) aren't _that_ much better than much simpler approaches"
52,B1YfAfcgl,Accept (Poster),Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys,"This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Entropy-SGD for training deep neural networks that is motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape. Local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Conceptually, our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights. We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions. Our experiments on convolutional and recurrent neural networks demonstrate that Entropy-SGD compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generalization error and training time.","['Deep learning', 'Optimization']","This paper presents both an analysis of neural net optimization landscapes, and an optimization algorithm that encourages movement in directions of high entropy. The motivation is based on intuitions from physics.
 
 Pros
  - the main idea is well-motivated, from a non-standard perspective.
  - There are lots of side-experiments supporting the claims for the motivation.
 Cons
  - The propose method is very complicated, and it sounds like good performance depended on adding and annealing yet another hyperparameter, referred to as 'scoping'.
  - The motivating intuition has been around for a long time in different forms. In particular, the proposed method is very closely related to stochastic variational inference, or MCMC methods. Appendix C makes it clear that the two methods aren't identical, but I wish the authors had simply run SVI with their proposed modification, instead of appearing to re-invent the idea of maximizing local volume from scratch. The intuition that good generalization comes from regions of high volume is also exactly what Bayes rule says.
 
 In summary, while there is improvement for the paper, the idea is well-motivated and the experimental results are sound."

The core of the method is a doubly-recurrent neural network that models separately the width and depth recurrences across the tree, and combines them inside each cell to generate an output. The topology of the tree is explicitly modeled, allowing the network to predict both content and topology of the tree when decoding. That is, given only an encoded vector representation, the network is able to simultaneously generate a tree from it and predict labels for the nodes. We test this architecture in an encoder-decoder framework, where we train a network to encode a sentence as a vector, and then generate a tree structure from it. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this architecture at recovering latent tree structure in sequences and at mapping sentences to simple functional programs.","['Natural language processing', 'Supervised Learning', 'Structured prediction']","The paper introduces a new model for generating trees decorated with node embeddings.

Like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions; realized as a neural network, it can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that the NPE's compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves its ability to predict movement, generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The paper proposes a Neural Physics Engine for predicting intuitive physics.

The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Transfer Learning']","The authors present a mixture of experts framework to combine learnt policies to improve multi-task learning while avoiding negative transfer.

The current standard approach to modeling neurons is to start with simple models and to incrementally add interpretable features. An alternative approach is to start with a more complex model that captures responses accurately, and then probe the fitted model structure to understand the neural computations. Here, we show that a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework provides the flexibility necessary to model complex computations of neurons that cannot be captured by previous methods. Specifically, multilayer recurrent neural networks that share features across neurons outperform generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The networks achieve good predictive performance given surprisingly small amounts of experimental training data. Additionally, we present a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model with separate spatial and temporal processing components which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks.","['Deep learning', 'Applications']","This work is an important step in developing the tools for understanding the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons.

For understanding of the visual algorithms in the brain, however, prediction performance is the most critical success criterion.

Due to the difficulty in obtaining the label information for high dimensional data, realizing this objective in an unsupervised way is highly desirable. Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is a classical tool for this problem. However, existing HSMM and its variants has simple conditional assumptions of observations, thus the ability to capture the nonlinear and complex dynamics within segments is limited. To tackle this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the generative process in HSMM, resulting the Recurrent HSMM (R-HSMM). To accelerate the inference while preserving accuracy, we designed a structure encoding function to mimic the exact inference.

69,Byiy-Pqlx,Accept (Poster),Lie-Access Neural Turing Machines,"
  External neural memory structures have recently become a popular tool for
  algorithmic deep learning
  (Graves et al. 2014; Weston et al. 2014).  These models
  generally utilize differentiable versions of traditional discrete
  memory-access structures (random access, stacks, tapes) to provide
  the storage necessary for computational tasks.  In
  this work, we argue that these neural memory systems lack specific
  structure important for relative indexing, and propose an
  alternative model, Lie-access memory, that is explicitly designed
  for the neural setting.  In this paradigm, memory is accessed using
  a continuous head in a key-space manifold. The head is moved via Lie
  group actions, such as shifts or rotations, generated by a
  controller, and memory access is performed by linear smoothing in
  key space. We argue that Lie groups provide a natural generalization
  of discrete memory structures, such as Turing machines, as they
  provide inverse and identity operators while maintaining
  differentiability. To experiment with this approach, we implement
  a simplified Lie-access neural Turing machine (LANTM) with
  different Lie groups.  We find that this approach is able to perform
  well on a range of algorithmic tasks.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","The paper presents a Lie-(group) access neural turing machine (LANTM) architecture, and demonstrates it's utility on several problems.

 It is likely to inspire further work into more effective generalizations of NTMs.

Many approaches, e.g. for state-of-the-art artistic style transfer or natural texture synthesis, rely on the statistics of hierarchical representations in supervisedly trained deep neural networks. It is, however, unclear what aspects of this feature representation are crucial for natural image generation: is it the depth, the pooling or the training of the features on natural images? We here address this question for the task of natural texture synthesis and show that none of the above aspects are indispensable. Instead, we demonstrate that natural textures of high perceptual quality can be generated from networks with only a single layer, no pooling and random filters.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The authors agreed that the paper presented a solid contribution and interesting (and somewhat surprising findings).

with a dynamic long-term memory which allows it to maintain and update a rep-
resentation of the state of the world as it receives new data. For language under-
standing tasks, it can reason on-the-fly as it reads text, not just when it is required
to answer a question or respond as is the case for a Memory Network (Sukhbaatar
et al., 2015). Like a Neural Turing Machine or Differentiable Neural Computer
(Graves et al., 2014; 2016) it maintains a fixed size memory and can learn to
perform location and content-based read and write operations. However, unlike
those models it has a simple parallel architecture in which several memory loca-
tions can be updated simultaneously. The EntNet sets a new state-of-the-art on
the bAbI tasks, and is the first method to solve all the tasks in the 10k training
examples setting. We also demonstrate that it can solve a reasoning task which
requires a large number of supporting facts, which other methods are not able to
solve, and can generalize past its training horizon. It can also be practically used
on large scale datasets such as Children’s Book Test, where it obtains competitive
performance, reading the story in a single pass.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","Reviewers found this work to be a ""well-motivated"", ""good contribution"", and ""clever"".

Our model is simple in design and only uses game states from the AI side, rather than using opponents' information.

We use a larger but more thoroughly regularized parser than other recent BiLSTM-based approaches, with
biaffine classifiers to predict arcs and labels. Our parser gets state of the art or near state of the art performance on standard treebanks for six different languages, achieving 95.7% UAS and 94.1% LAS on the most popular English PTB dataset. This makes it the highest-performing graph-based parser on this benchmark—outperforming Kiperwasser & Goldberg (2016) by 1.8% and 2.2%—and comparable to the highest performing transition-based parser (Kuncoro et al., 2016), which achieves 95.8% UAS and 94.6% LAS. We also show which hyperparameter choices had a significant effect on parsing accuracy, allowing us to achieve large gains over other graph-based approaches.
","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","The area chair disagrees with the reviewers and actually thinks this is a very important contribution. This paper has the potential to be have huge impact as it sets a new state of the art on a 20+ year old benchmark with a simple model. The simplicity of the model is what is so impressive, because it resets how people think about syntactic parsing as a task. The contributions in this paper have the potential to unleash a series of model simplifications in a number of areas and the area chair therefore strongly suggests accepting the paper.
 
 It is true that the techniques used in this paper are not new inventions but rather a careful combination of ideas proposed in other places. However, in the area chair's opinion this is a substantial contribution. There are lots of ideas out there and knowing which ideas to pick and how to combine them is very valuable. Showing that a simple model can beat more complicated models advances our understanding much more than a new technique that adds unnecessary additional complexity.

Human experts routinely inspect the resulting learning curves to quickly terminate runs with poor hyperparameter settings and thereby considerably speed up manual hyperparameter optimization. Exploiting the same information in automatic Bayesian hyperparameter optimization requires a probabilistic model of learning curves across hyperparameter settings. Here, we study the use of Bayesian neural networks for this purpose and improve their performance by a specialized learning curve layer.","['Deep learning', 'Applications']","The reviewers agreed that this is a good paper that proposes an interesting approach to modeling training curves. The approach is well motivated in terms of surrogate based (e.g. Bayesian) optimization. They are convinced that a great model of training curves could be used to extrapolate in the future, greatly expediting hyperparameter search methods through early stopping. None of the reviewers championed the paper, however. They all stated that the paper just did not go far enough in showing that the method is really useful in practice. While the authors seem to have added some interesting additional results to this effect, it was a little too late for the reviewers to take into account. 
 
 It seems like this paper would benefit from some added experiments as per the authors' suggestions. Incorporating this within a Bayesian optimization methodology is certainly non-trivial (e.g. may require rethinking the modeling and acquisition function) but could be very impactful. The overall pros and cons are as follows:
 
 Pros:
 - Proposes a neat model for extrapolating training curves
 - Experiments show that the model can extrapolate quite well
 - It addresses a strong limitation of current hyperparameter optimization techniques
 
 Cons
 - The reviewers were underwhelmed with the experimental analysis
 - The paper did not push the ideas far enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach

We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks. Finally, we develop a mean field theory for backpropagation and we show that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradient respectively.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","This is one of the two top papers in my stack.

Recent efforts toward reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting original accuracy.  However, magnitude-based pruning of weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.

Our experiments show that the precision of our model is comparable to that of neural networks while sharing a number of advantages with n-gram models such as fast query time and the capability to quickly add and remove training data samples. Further, the model is parameterized by a program that can be manually inspected, understood and updated, addressing a major problem of neural networks.",[],"This work was a very controversial submission, with two strong accepts and one initial strong reject.

 - There is strong originality to this work. One of the few submissions in the area not just using RNNs for LM.
 - The paper shows strong empirical results on PL language modeling, comparative results in natural language modeling, fast lookup compared to neural models, and presents a significantly different approach then the currently accepted NN methods. 
 
 
 Cons:
 - The original draft has clarity issues. In particular the MCMC approach is very difficult to follow and lacks clear explanation for this community, the interpretability of the method is not demonstrated, and too much of the work is devoted to laying out the language itself.

This can accelerate acquisition of new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where twp agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed as a kind of ``analogy making,'' or implicit learning of partial correspondences between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Transfer Learning']","pros:

A shared component of some popular models such as generative adversarial networks and generative moment matching networks, is a decoder network, a parametric deep neural net that defines a generative distribution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to quantify the performance of these models because of the intractability of log-likelihood estimation, and inspecting samples can be misleading. We propose to use Annealed Importance Sampling for evaluating log-likelihoods for decoder-based models and validate its accuracy using bidirectional Monte Carlo. Using this technique, we analyze the performance of decoder-based models, the effectiveness of existing log-likelihood estimators, the degree of overfitting, and the degree to which these models miss important modes of the data distribution.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","This paper describes a method to estimate likelihood scores for a range of models defined by a decoder.

Updating the upper bound during the optimization leads to improved classification rates while transforming the learning into a sequence of minimization problems. In addition, in the context where the classifier is part of a larger system, this modification makes it possible to link the performance of the classifier to that of the whole system, allowing the seamless introduction of external constraints.",[],"This is a well written paper that proposes the adaptation of the loss function for training during optimization, based on a simple and effective tighter bound on classification error.

82,Bk0FWVcgx,Accept (Poster),Topology and Geometry of Half-Rectified Network Optimization,"The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest 
in the optimization and machine learning communities as a prime example of 
high-dimensional non-convex problem. Some insights were recently gained using spin glass 
models and mean-field approximations, but at the expense of strongly simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model.

In this work, we do not make any such approximation and study conditions 
on the data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence 
of bad local minima. Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two 
important folklore facts: (i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology 
from that of deep half-rectified ones, and (ii) that the energy landscape 
in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay.

The conditioning of gradient descent is the next challenge we address. 
We study this question through the geometry of the level sets, and we introduce
an algorithm to efficiently estimate the regularity of such sets on large-scale networks. 
Our empirical results show that these level sets remain connected throughout 
all the learning phase, suggesting a near convex behavior, but they become 
exponentially more curvy as the energy level decays, in accordance to what is observed in practice with 
very low curvature attractors.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","The paper presents an analysis of deep ReLU networks, and contrasts it with linear networks. It makes good progress towards providing a theoretical explanation of the difficult problem of characterizing the critical points of this highly nonconvex function. 

I agree with the authors that their approach is superior to earlier works based on spin-glass models or other approximations that make highly unrealistic assumptions. The ReLU structure allows them to provide concrete analysis, without making such approximations, as opposed to more general activation units.

The relationship between smoothness of data distribution and the level of model overparamterization is used to characterize the ability to reach the global optimum. The intuition that having no approximation error (due to overparameterization) leads to more tractable optimization problem is intuitive. Such findings have been seen before (e.g. in tensor decomposition, the global optima can be reached when the amount of noise is small). I recommend the authors to connect it to such findings for other nonconvex problems.  The paper does not address overfitting, as they themselves point out in the conclusion. However, I do expect it to be a very challenging problem."

We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels. Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size. Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time. Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","The paper is well written and easy to follow.

Instead of experimenting on other known large-scale language modeling setups, the authors introduce their own new dataset (which is 1 order of magnitude smaller than the 1-Billion LM dataset by Chelba et al).

The novel training procedure to learn this progressive denoising operation involves sampling from a slightly different chain than the model chain used for generation in the absence of a denoising target. In the training chain we infuse information from the training target example that we would like the chains to reach with a high probability.

Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including to unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from the target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Applications']","The approach here looks at learning policies that are robust over a parameterized class of MDPs (in the sense the probability that the policy doesn't perform well is small over this class.

The reviewers were all in agreement that the paper is worth accepting.
 
 Pros:
 + Nice application of robust (really stochastic, since these are chance constraints) optimization to policy search
 + Compelling demonstration of the improved range of good performance over methods like vanilla TRPO

The mathematical theory of steerable representations reveals a type system in which any steerable representation is a composition of elementary feature types, each one associated with a particular kind of symmetry.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.  We also compare our learned experimentation policies to randomized baselines and show that the learned policies lead to better predictions.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","The following statement best summarizes the contribution: ""This paper shows that model free RL methods can learn how to gather information about physical properties of objects, even when this information is not available to a passive observer, and use this information to make decisions.""

tree-structured neural networks for computing representations of natural language sentences.
In contrast with prior work on tree-structured models, in which the trees are either provided as input or
predicted using supervision from explicit treebank annotations,
the tree structures in this work are optimized to improve performance on a downstream task.
Experiments demonstrate the benefit of
learning task-specific composition orders, outperforming both sequential encoders and recursive encoders based on treebank annotations.

they are different than conventional English syntactic structures.",[],"All the reviewers agreed that the research direction is very interesting, and generally find the results promising. We could quibble a bit about the results not being really state-of-the-art and the choice of baselines, but I think the main claims are well supported by the experiments (i.e. the induce grammar appears to be useful for the problem in question, within the specific class of models). There are still clearly many issues unresolved, and we are yet to see if this class of methods (RL / implicit structure-based) can lead to state-of-the-art results on any important NLP problem.

91,HkwoSDPgg,Accept (Oral),Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data,"Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such
as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may
inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis
of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.

To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to
providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in
a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as
records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive
data, these models are not published, but instead used as ''teachers'' for a ''student'' model. 
The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting
among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or
the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be
understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset
dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy.
 These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but
also inspect its internal workings.

Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how
teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like
DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN
thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.
",[],"The paper presents a general teacher-student approach for differentially-private learning in which the student learns to predict a noise vote among a set of teachers. The noise allows the student to be differentially private, whilst maintaining good classification accuracies on MNIST and SVHN. The paper is well-written."
92,Sk-oDY9ge,Accept (Poster),Diet Networks: Thin Parameters for Fat Genomics,"Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Supervised Learning', 'Applications']","The reviewers agreed that the paper proposed a solid and original contribution that was evaluated well.

text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically
deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address
this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi-
cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the
first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),
which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This
model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component
collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy
with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we
find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational
optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied
to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic
model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product
of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA
yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs
sampling.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Applications', 'Optimization']","The reviewers agree that the approach is interesting and the paper presents useful findings.

95,SkpSlKIel,Accept (Poster),Why Deep Neural Networks for Function Approximation?,"Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural networks are preferred to shallow networks. We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on $\varepsilon$) require $\Omega(\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with $1/\varepsilon$) require $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU.
",[],"The paper makes a solid technical contribution in proving that the deep networks are exponentially more efficient in function approximation compared to the shallow networks. They take the case of piecewise smooth networks, which is practically motivated (e.g. images have edges with smooth regions), and analyze the size of both the deep and shallow networks required to approximate it to the same degree.

All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional \emph{Labyrinth} tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10$\times$ and averaging 87\% expert human performance on Labyrinth.",[],"There was broad consensus by the reviewers that this paper should be accepted.

97,ryT4pvqll,Accept (Poster),Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards,"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. We find that our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Notably, the approach is able to solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.",['Reinforcement Learning'],"This paper proposes a nice algorithm for improved exploration in policy search RL settings. The method essentially optimizes a weighted combination of expected reward (essentially the REINFORCE objective without an entropy regularizer) plus a term from the reward augmented maximum likelihood objective (from a recent NIPS paper), and show that the resulting update can be made with a fairly small modification to the REINFORCE algorithm. The authors show improved performance on several sequential ""program-like"" domains like copying a string, adding, etc.
 
 I'm recommending this paper for acceptance, as I think the contribution here is a good one, and the basic approach very nicely offers a better exploration policy than the typical Boltzmann policy, using a fairly trivial modification to REINFORCE. But after re-reading I'm less enthusiastic, simply because the delta over previous work (namely the RAML paper) doesn't seem incredibly substantial. None of the domains in the experiments seem substantially challenges, and the fact that it can improve over REINFORCE isn't necessarily amazing.
 
 Pros:
 + Well-motivated (and simple) modification to REINFORCE to get better exploration
 + Demonstrably better performance with seemingly less hyperparameter tunies
 
 Cons:
 - Delta over RAML work isn't that clear, essentially is just a weighted combination between REINFORCE and RAML (though in RL context)

functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which
can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction,
towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution.
We introduce several ways of regularizing the objective, which can dramatically
stabilize the training of GAN models. We also show that our regularizers can help
the fair distribution of probability mass across the modes of the data generating
distribution during the early phases of training, thus providing a unified solution
to the missing modes problem.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","This paper presents some intuitions about why GAN training is difficult, and proposes a somewhat remedy that seems to help.

Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.

Specifically, PL-CNNs employ piecewise linear non-linearities such as the commonly used ReLU and max-pool, and an SVM classifier as the final layer. The key observation of our approach is that the prob- lem corresponding to the parameter estimation of a layer can be formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, which happens to be a latent structured SVM. We optimize the DC program using the concave-convex procedure, which requires us to iteratively solve a structured SVM problem. This allows to design an opti- mization algorithm with an optimal learning rate that does not require any tuning. Using the MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet data sets, we show that our approach always improves over the state of the art variants of backpropagation and scales to large data and large network settings.",[],"The authors present a novel layer-wise optimization approach for learning convolutional neural networks with piecewise linear nonlinearities.

The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using MS-SSIM.",[],This is one of the two top papers in my stack and I recommend it for oral presentation.

To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules.

We show experimentally that all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit.

As a result, this class of models efficiently learns both the class of objects in an image, and their specific realization in pixels, from unsupervised data; and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The authors present a novel reparameterization framework for VAEs with discrete random variables. The idea is to carry out symmetric projections of the approximate posterior and the prior into a continuous space and evaluating the autoencoder term in that space by marginalizing out the discrete variables. They consider the KL divergence between the approximating posterior and the true prior in the original discrete space and show that due to the symmetry of the projection into the continuous space, it does not
 contribute to the KL term. 
 
 One question that warrants further investigation is whether this framework can be extended to GANs and what empirical success they would have.
 
 The reviewers have presented a strong case for the acceptance of the paper and I go with their recommendation."
113,SJGPL9Dex,Accept (Poster),Understanding Trainable Sparse Coding with Matrix Factorization,"Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in \cite{Gregor10}, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.

In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.","['Theory', 'Deep learning', 'Optimization']","The work is fairly unique in that it provides a theoretical explanation for an empirical phenomenon in the world of sparse coding. The reviewers were overall favourable, although some reviewers thought parts of the paper were unclear or had confusion about the relationship to LISTA. I suspect the analysis here could also shed light on other problems."
114,rJ0-tY5xe,Accept (Poster),"Learning to Query, Reason, and Answer Questions On Ambiguous Texts","A key goal of research in conversational systems is to train an interactive agent to help a user with a task. Human conversation, however, is notoriously incomplete, ambiguous, and full of extraneous detail. To operate effectively, the agent must not only understand what was explicitly conveyed but also be able to reason in the presence of missing or unclear information. When unable to resolve ambiguities on its own, the agent must be able to ask the user for the necessary clarifications and incorporate the response in its reasoning. Motivated by this problem we introduce QRAQ (""crack""; Query, Reason, and Answer Questions), a new synthetic domain, in which a User gives an Agent a short story and asks a challenge question. These problems are designed to test the reasoning and interaction capabilities of a learning-based Agent in a setting that requires multiple conversational turns. A good Agent should ask only non-deducible, relevant questions until it has enough information to correctly answer the User's question. We use standard and improved reinforcement learning based memory-network architectures to solve QRAQ problems in the difficult setting where the reward signal only tells the Agent if its final answer to the challenge question is correct or not. To provide an upper-bound to the RL results we also train the same architectures using supervised information that tells the Agent during training which variables to query and the answer to the challenge question. We evaluate our architectures on four QRAQ dataset types, and scale the complexity for each along multiple dimensions.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","The program committee appreciates the authors' response to concerns raised in the reviews.

115,S1LVSrcge,Accept (Poster),Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data. Much of this progress has been achieved through devising recurrent units and architectures with the flexibility to capture complex statistics in the data, such as long range dependency or localized attention phenomena. However, while many sequential data (such as video, speech or language) can have highly variable information flow, most recurrent models still consume input features at a constant rate and perform a constant number of computations per time step, which can be detrimental to both speed and model capacity. In this paper, we explore a modification to existing recurrent units which allows them to learn to vary the amount of computation they perform at each step, without prior knowledge of the sequence's time structure. We show experimentally that not only do our models require fewer operations, they also lead to better performance overall on evaluation tasks.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","This paper describes a new way of variable computation, which uses a different number of units depending on the input. This is different from other methods for variable computation that compute over multiple time steps.

 Pros:
 - new idea
 - convincing results in a head to head comparison between different set ups.
 
 Cons:
 - results are not nearly as good as the state of the art on the reported tasks.
 
 The reviewers and I had several rounds of discussion on whether or not to accept the paper. One reviewer had significant reservations about the paper since the results were far from SOTA. However, since getting SOTA often requires a combination of several tricks, I felt that perhaps it would not be fair to require this, and gave them the benefit of doubt (especially because the other two reviewers did not think this was a dealbreaker). In my opinion, the authors did a fair enough job on the head to head comparison between their proposed VCRNN models and the underlying LSTMs and GRUs, which showed that the model did well enough."
116,H1fl8S9ee,Accept (Poster),Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks,"We present an algorithm for policy search in stochastic dynamical systems using
model-based reinforcement learning. The system dynamics are described with
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that include stochastic input variables.  These
input variables allow us to capture complex statistical
patterns in the transition dynamics (e.g. multi-modality and
heteroskedasticity), which are usually missed by alternative modeling approaches. After
learning the dynamics, our BNNs are then fed into an algorithm that performs
random roll-outs and uses stochastic optimization for policy learning. We train
our BNNs by minimizing $\alpha$-divergences with $\alpha = 0.5$, which usually produces better
results than other techniques such as variational Bayes. We illustrate the performance of our method by
solving a challenging problem where model-based approaches usually fail and by
obtaining promising results in real-world scenarios including the control of a
gas turbine and an industrial benchmark.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","Despite it's initial emphasis on policy search, this paper is really about a learning method for Bayesian neural networks, which it then uses in a policy search setting. Specifically, the authors advocate modeling a stochastic system using a BNN trained to minimize alpha-divergence with alpha=0.5 (this involves a great deal of approximation to make computationally tractable). They then use this in the policy search setting.
 
 The paper is quite clear, and proposes a nice approach to learning BNNs. The algorithmic impact honestly seems fairly minor (the idea of using different alpha-divergences instead of KL divergence has been considered many times in the content of general variational approximations), but combining this with the policy search setting, and reasonable examples of industrial control, together these all make this a fairly strong paper.
 
 Pros:
 + Nice derivation of alternative variational formulation (I'll still call it variational even though it uses alpha-divergence with alpha=0.5)
 + Good integration into policy search setting
 + Nice application to industrial control systems
 
 Cons:
 - Advance from the algorithmic standpoint seems fairly straightforward, if complicated to make tractable (variational inference using alpha-divergence is not a new idea)
 - The RL components here aren't particularly novel, really the novelty is in the learning"

The task is often approached by mapping natural language queries to logical forms or programs that provide the desired response when executed on the database. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model to induce such programs on a real-world dataset. We enhance the objective function of Neural Programmer, a neural network with built-in discrete operations, and apply it on WikiTableQuestions, a natural language question-answering dataset. The model is trained end-to-end with weak supervision of question-answer pairs, and does not require domain-specific grammars, rules, or annotations that are key elements in previous approaches to program induction. The main experimental result in this paper is that a single Neural Programmer model achieves 34.2% accuracy using only 10,000 examples with weak supervision. An ensemble of 15 models, with a trivial combination technique, achieves 37.7% accuracy, which is competitive to the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 37.1% obtained by a traditional natural language semantic parser.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","The paper applies a previously introduced method (from ICLR '16) to the challenging question answering dataset (wikitables).

Still, achieving strong results on this moderately sized dataset with an expressive 
 model is far from trivial. Though the approach, as has been discussed, does not directly generalize to QA with large knowledge bases (as well as other end-to-end differentiable methods for the QA task proposed so far), it is an important step forward and the task is already realistic and important.

Recently, there have been a number of attempts on binarizing the network weights and activations. This greatly reduces the network size, and replaces the underlying multiplications to additions or even XNOR bit operations. However, existing binarization schemes are based on simple matrix approximations and ignore the effect of binarization on the loss. In this paper, we propose a proximal Newton algorithm with diagonal Hessian approximation that directly minimizes the loss w.r.t. the binarized weights. The underlying proximal step has an efficient closed-form solution, and the second-order information can be efficiently obtained from the second moments already computed by the Adam optimizer. Experiments on both feedforward and recurrent networks show that the proposed loss-aware binarization algorithm outperforms existing binarization schemes, and is also more robust for wide and deep networks.","['Deep learning', 'Applications', 'Optimization']","It's a simple contribution supported by empirical and theoretical analyses.

We present Hyperband,  a novel algorithm for hyperparameter optimization that is simple, flexible, and theoretically sound.  Hyperband is a principled early-stoppping method that adaptively allocates a predefined resource, e.g., iterations, data samples or number of features, to randomly sampled configurations.  We compare Hyperband with state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods on several hyperparameter optimization problems.  We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order of magnitude speedups over competitors on a variety of neural network and kernel-based learning problems.  ",[],"This paper presents a simple strategy for hyperparameter optimization that gives strong empirical results. The reviewers all agreed that the paper should be accepted and that it would be interesting and useful to the ICLR community. However, they did have strong reservations about the claims made in the paper and one reviewer stated that their accept decision was conditional on a better treatment of the related literature. 
 
 While it is natural for authors to argue for the advantages of their approach over existing methods, some of the claims made are unfounded. For example, the claim that the proposed method is guaranteed to converge while ""methods that rely on these heuristics are not endowed with any
 theoretical consistency guarantees"" is weak. Any optimization method can trivially add this guarantee by adopting a simple strategy of adding a random experiment 1/n of the time (in fact, SMAC does this I believe). This claim is true of random search compared to gradient based optimization on non-convex functions as well, yet no one optimizes their deep nets via random search. Also, the authors claim to compare to state-of-the-art in hyperparameter optimization but all the comparisons are to algorithms published in either 2011 or 2012. Four years of continued research on the subject are ignored (e.g. methods in Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning have evolved considerably since 2012 - see e.g. the work of Miguel Hern‡ndez Lobato, Matthew Hoffman, Nando de Freitas, Ziyu Wang, etc.). It's understood that it is difficult to compare to the latest literature (and the authors state that they had trouble running recent algorithms), but one can't claim to compare to state-of-the-art without actually comparing to state-of-the-art.

We demonstrate on several language model datasets that our approach performs significantly better than recent memory augmented networks.",['Natural language processing'],"Reviewers agree that this paper is based on a ""trick"" to build memory without requiring long-distance backprop.

 Including the discussion about this paper as it might be helpful as it was controversial: 
 
 """"""
 The technical contribution may appear ""limited"" but I feel part of that is necessary to ensure the method can scale to both large datasets and long term dependencies. For me, this is similar to simpler machine learning methods being able to scale to more data (though replacing ""data"" with ""timesteps""). More complex methods may do better with a small number of data/timesteps but they won't be able to scale, where other specific advantages may come in to play.
 
 (Timesteps)
 
 Looking back 2000 timesteps is something I've not seen done and speaks to a broader aspect of language modeling - properly capturing recent article level context. Most language models limit BPTT to around 35 timesteps, with some even arguing we don't need that much (i.e. ""Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling"" that's under review for ICLR). From a general perspective, this is vaguely mad given many sentences are longer than 35 timesteps, yet we know both intuitively and from the evidence they present that the rest of an article is very likely to help modeling the following words, especially for PTB or WikiText.
 
 This paper introduces a technique that not only allows for utilizing dependencies far further back than 35 timesteps but shows it consistently helps, even when thrown against a larger number of timesteps, a larger dataset, or a larger vocabulary. Given it is also a post-processing step that can be applied to any vaguely RNN type model, it's widely applicable and trivial to train in comparison to any more complicated models.
 
 (Data)
 
 Speaking to AnonReviewer1's comment, ""A side-by-side comparison of models with pointer networks vs. models with cache with roughly the same number of parameters is needed to convincingly argue that the proposed method is a better alternative (either because it achieves lower perplexity, faster to train but similar test perplexity, faster at test time, etc.)""
 
 Existing pointer network approaches for language modeling are very slow to train - or at least more optimal methods are yet to be discovered - and has such limited the BPTT length they tackle. Merity et al. use 100 at most and that's the only pointer method for language modeling attending to article style text that I am aware of. Merity et al. also have a section of their paper specifically discussing the training speed complications that come from integrating the pointer network. There is a comparison to Merity et al. in Table 1 and Table 2.
 
 The scaling becomes more obvious on the WikiText datasets which have a more realistic long tail vocabulary than PTB's 10k. For WikiText-2, at a cache size of 100, Merity et al. get 80.8 with their pointer network method while the neural cache model get 81.6. Increasing the neural model cache size to 2000 however gives quite a substantial drop to 68.9. They're also able to apply their method to WikiText-103, a far larger dataset than PTB or WikiText-2, and show that it still provides improvements even when there is more data and a larger vocabulary. Scaling to this dataset is only sanely possible as the neural cache model doesn't add to the training time of the base neural model at all - that it's equivalent to training a standard LSTM.

We focus on micromanagement, that is, the short-term, low-level control of team members during a battle. We propose several scenarios that are challenging for reinforcement learning algorithms because the state- action space is very large, and there is no obvious feature representation for the value functions. We describe our approach to tackle the micromanagement scenarios with deep neural network controllers from raw state features given by the game engine. We also present a heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm which combines direct exploration in the policy space and backpropagation. This algorithm collects traces for learning using deterministic policies, which appears much more efficient than, e.g., ε-greedy exploration. Experiments show that this algorithm allows to successfully learn non-trivial strategies for scenarios with armies of up to 15 agents, where both Q-learning and REINFORCE struggle.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Games']","The paper presents an approach to structured exploration in StarCraft micromanagement policies (essentially small tasks in the game). From an application standpoint, this is a notable advance, since the authors are tackling a challenging domain and in doing so develop a novel exploration algorithm that seems to work quite well here.
 
 The main downside of the paper is that the proposed algorithm does seem fairly ad-hoc: certain approximations in the algorithm, like ignoring the argmax term in computing the backprop, are not really justified except in that it ""seems to work well in practice"" (a quote from the paper), so it's really unclear whether these represent general techniques or just a method that happens to work well on the target domain for poorly understood reasons.
 
 Despite this, however, I think the strength of the application is sufficient here. Deep learning has been alternatively pushed forward by more algorithmic/mathematical advances and more applied advances, with many of the major breakthroughs coming from seemingly ad-hoc strategies applied to challenging problems. This paper falls in that later category: the ZO algorithm may or may not lead to something slightly more disciplined in the future, but for now the compelling results on StarCraft are I believe enough to warrant accepting the paper.
 
 Pros:
 + Substantial performance improvement (over basic techniques like Q-learning) on a challenging task
 + Nice intuitive justification of a new exploration approach

We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images.

Nevertheless, the resulting CNNs offer limited benefits. While pruning the fully connected layers reduces a CNN's size considerably, it does not improve inference speed noticeably as the compute heavy parts lie in convolutions. Pruning CNNs in a way that increase inference speed often imposes specific sparsity structures, thus limiting the achievable sparsity levels.

We present a method to realize simultaneously size economy and speed improvement while pruning CNNs. Paramount to our success is an efficient general sparse-with-dense matrix
multiplication implementation that is applicable to convolution of feature maps with kernels of arbitrary sparsity patterns. Complementing this, we developed a performance model that predicts sweet spots of sparsity levels for different layers and on different computer architectures. Together, these two allow us to demonstrate 3.1-7.3x convolution speedups over dense convolution in AlexNet, on Intel Atom, Xeon, and Xeon Phi processors, spanning the spectrum from mobile devices to supercomputers.

We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.",[],"This paper proposes an interesting architecture for predicting future frames of videos using end-to-end trained deep predictive coding.

Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation.  In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges.  In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters.  We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks.  A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example.  We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora.  We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers.  On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.",['Deep learning'],"The paper uses mixtures of experts to increase the capacity of deep networks, and describes the implementation of such a model on a cluster of GPUs.

133,SJ3rcZcxl,Accept (Oral),Q-Prop: Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient with An Off-Policy Critic,"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","This paper presents a nice contribution to the RL literature, finding an intermediate point between the high-variance (but unbiased) gradient estimates from policy optimization methods, and low(er)-variance (but biased) gradient estimates from off-policy actor-critic methods like DDPG. The basic idea (as I'm interpreting it, similar to one of the reviewers below), that that we can use an action-dependent baseline, based upon off-policy learning, to lower the variance of the gradient, assuming we also correct for it in the gradient computation. The experiments clearly show the benefit of the proposed approach. The work is a nice combination/unification of two prominent trends in RL (with the overarching goal of reducing sample complexity, which is of course crucial here), and I believe is absolutely worth accepting. The authors also did an excellent job responding to reviewer concerns and adjusting the manuscript to address any issues raised.
 
 Pros:
 + Nice contribution combining off-policy and on-policy methods, with a novel and compelling algorithm
 + Good evaluation on a wide variety of control tasks

134,r1VdcHcxx,Accept (Poster),Recurrent Batch Normalization,"We propose a reparameterization of LSTM that brings the benefits of batch normalization to recurrent neural networks. Whereas previous works only apply batch normalization to the input-to-hidden transformation of RNNs, we demonstrate that it is both possible and beneficial to batch-normalize the hidden-to-hidden transition, thereby reducing internal covariate shift between time steps.

We evaluate our proposal on various sequential problems such as sequence classification, language modeling and question answering. Our empirical results show that our batch-normalized LSTM consistently leads to faster convergence and improved generalization.","['Deep learning', 'Optimization']","The reviewers believe this paper is of significant interest to the ICLR community, as it demonstrates how to get the popular batch normalization method to work in the recurrent setting. The fact that it has already been cited a variety of times also speaks to its interest within the community. The extensive experiments are convincing that the method works. One common criticism is that the authors don't address enough the added computational cost of the method in the text or empirically. Plots showing loss as a function of wall-clock time instead of training iteration would be more informative to readers deciding whether to use batch norm. 
 
 Pros: 
 - Gets batch normalization to work on recurrent networks (which had been elusive to many)
 - The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the method reduces training time (as a function of training iterations)
 - The paper is well written and accessible
 
 Cons
 - The contribution is relatively incremental (several tweaks to an existing method)
 - The major disadvantage to the approach is the added computational cost, but this is conspicuously not addressed."
135,BkVsEMYel,Accept (Poster),Inductive Bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry,"Our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","The paper uses the notion of separation rank from tensor algebra to analyze the correlations induced through convolution and pooling operations. They show that deep networks have exponentially larger separation ranks compared to shallow ones, and thus, can induce a much richer correlation structure compared to shallow networks. It is argued that this rich inductive bias is crucial for empirical success.
 
 The paper is technically solid. The reviewers note this, and also make a few suggestions on how to make the paper more accessible. The authors have taken this into account. In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice, it is essential for theory papers to be accessible.

136,HyQJ-mclg,Accept (Poster),Incremental Network Quantization: Towards Lossless CNNs with Low-precision Weights,"This paper presents incremental network quantization (INQ), a novel method, targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose weights are constrained to be either powers of two or zero. Unlike existing methods which are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve this issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the first group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are quantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations are repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all the weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental network quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the efficacy of the proposed method. Specifically, at 5-bit quantization (a variable-length encoding: 1 bit for representing zero value, and the remaining 4 bits represent at most 16 different values for the powers of two), our models have improved accuracy than the 32-bit floating-point references. Taking ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights have improved or very similar accuracy against its 32-bit floating-point baseline. Besides, impressive results with the combination of network pruning and INQ are also reported. We believe that our method sheds new insights on how to make deep CNNs to be applicable on mobile or embedded devices. The code will be made publicly available.","['Deep learning', 'Optimization']","The paper presents a method for iterative quantization of neural networks weights to powers of 2.

We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for regularizing deep neural networks and achieving better optimization performance. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense) step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint, re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero and retrain the whole dense network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1 accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1%, VGG-16 by 4.3%, ResNet-18 by 1.2% and ResNet-50 by 1.1%, respectively. On the WSJ’93 dataset, DSD improved DeepSpeech and DeepSpeech2 WER by 2.0% and 1.1%. On the Flickr-8K dataset, DSD improved the NeuralTalk BLEU score by over 1.7. DSD is easy to use in practice: at training time, DSD incurs only one extra hyper-parameter: the sparsity ratio in the S step. At testing time, DSD doesn’t change the network architecture or incur any inference overhead. The consistent and significant performance gain of DSD experiments shows the inadequacy of the current training methods for finding the best local optimum, while DSD effectively achieves superior optimization performance for finding a better solution.

139,rJbbOLcex,Accept (Poster),TopicRNN: A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency,"In this paper, we propose TopicRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence – both semantic and syntactic – but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset and report an error rate of 6.28%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art 5.91% resulting from a semi-supervised approach. Finally, TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","Though the have been attempts to incorporate both ""topic-like"" and ""sequence-like"" methods in the past (e.g, the work of Hanna Wallach, Amit Gruber and other), they were quite computationally expensive, especially when high-order ngrams are incorporated. This is a modern take on this challenge: using RNNs and the VAE / inference network framework. The results are quite convincing, and the paper is well written.
 
 Pros:
 -- clean and simple model
 -- sufficiently convincing experimentation
 
 Cons:
 -- other ways to model interaction between RNN and topic representation could be considered (see comments of R2 and R1)"

We show that deep networks can efficiently extract the intrinsic, low-dimensional coordinates of such data.  Specifically we show that the first two layers of a deep network can exactly embed points lying on a monotonic chain, a special type of piecewise linear manifold, mapping them to a low-dimensional Euclidean space.  Remarkably, the network can do this using an almost optimal number of parameters. We also show that this network projects nearby points onto the manifold and then embeds them with little error. Experiments demonstrate that training with stochastic gradient descent can indeed find efficient representations similar to the one presented in this paper.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","There is consensus among the reviewers that the paper presents an interesting and novel direction of study. Having said that, there also appears to be a sense that the proposed construction can be studied in more detail: in particular, (1) an average-case analysis is essential as the worst-case bounds appear extremely loose and (2) the learning problem needs to be addressed in more detail.

However, the presence of inaccurate class labels is known  to deteriorate the performance of even the best classifiers in a broad range of classification problems. Noisy labels also  tend to be more harmful than noisy attributes. When the observed label is noisy, we can view the correct label as a latent random variable and model the noise processes by a communication channel with unknown parameters. Thus we can apply the EM algorithm to find the parameters of both the network and the noise  and to estimate the correct label. In this study we present a neural-network approach that optimizes  the same likelihood function as optimized by the EM algorithm. The noise is explicitly modeled by an additional softmax layer that connects the correct labels to the noisy ones. This scheme is then extended  to the case where the noisy labels are dependent  on the features in addition to the correct labels.  Experimental results demonstrate that this approach  outperforms previous methods.

Repeated application of a simple expansion rule generates deep networks whose structural layouts are precisely truncated fractals.  These networks contain interacting subpaths of different lengths, but do not include any pass-through or residual connections; every internal signal is transformed by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequent layers.  In experiments, fractal networks match the excellent performance of standard residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks.  Rather, the key may be the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep.  We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in fractal architectures.  Such regularization allows extraction of high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks.  Additionally, fractal networks exhibit an anytime property: shallow subnetworks provide a quick answer, while deeper subnetworks, with higher latency, provide a more accurate answer.",[],"The paper describes a novel and simple way of constructing deep neural networks using a fractal expansion rule.

It reduces the number of distinct network parameter values by quantization in order to save the storage for them. In this paper, we design network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. We analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the neural network loss function and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function for the optimization of network quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyd's algorithm. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, we show from our experiments that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable for LeNet, 32-layer ResNet and AlexNet, respectively.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","The paper proposes using quantization schemes to compress the weights of a neural network.

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties

approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in
practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art
convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic
gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This
phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs
even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We
corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction

For an agent with a limited computational budget, this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples, while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single, fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller which learns to optimize a sequence of ""imagined"" internal simulations over predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each iteration. The models (which we call ""experts"") can be state transition models, action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were trained with ""interaction networks"" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models, our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more traditional fixed policy approaches.

Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks.","['Deep learning', 'Applications', 'Optimization']","After discussion, the reviewers unanimously recommend accepting the paper."

New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","This paper comes up with a novel approach to searching the space of architectures for deep neural networks using reinforcement learning. The idea is straightforward and sensible: use a reinforcement learning strategy to iteratively grow a deep net graph (the space of actions is e.g. adding different layer types) via Q-learning. The reviewers agree that the idea is interesting, novel and promising but are underwhelmed with the execution of the experiments and the empirical results. 
 
 The idea behind the paper and the formulation of the problem are quite similar to a concurrent submission (https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Ue8Hcxg) which has much higher scores. That paper formulates their reinforcement learning strategy using the REINFORCE algorithm while this one uses Q-learning. The major discrepancy between the papers is in the execution of the experiments. This paper had a much more restricted set of experiments on a smaller search space and thus had less impressive results. The other paper explored a much larger space of architectures and explored recurrent neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art on multiple tasks and finding exciting novel architectures that challenge current standard models (LSTMs). As a result that paper received three 9's and this one three 6's.
 
 The authors argue that they had almost the same idea but did not have access to the same amount of computing resources as the other paper. That certainly is warranted as the other paper used an *extreme* amount of compute resources for their experiments. 
 
 Given the average scores of ICLR and target acceptance rate, three 6s should normally be considered a reject. Specifically, in the absence of the other paper this would be rejected. However, the authors argue that this would be unfair, since the major difference was simply in compute resources. A major concern of the reviewers was that this approach was too computationally expensive, which is strongly contradictory to the scores for the other paper. In reality, the other paper really is just much more interesting because of the empirical results. However, I sympathize with the authors as the other paper essentially demonstrates that their idea is sensible and effective (albeit only with obscene compute resources), and the paper would effectively be ""scooped"" from further submissions.
 
 (Note a contrarian viewpoint might take an analogy from other fields. e.g. experimental physics papers are likely rejected if they don't have multi-billion dollar equipment to run the right set of exhaustive experiments, which is the difference between e.g. the large hadron collider and most university depts.)
 
 Pros:
 - The paper proposes a novel approach to architecture search using reinforcement learning
 - The approach is technically sound and interesting
 - The authors achieve good results automatically on benchmark tasks using their approach
 - They empirically demonstrate that their method works (via plots demonstrating the behavior of the algorithm while varying how exploratory the algorithm is)
 
 Cons:
 - The search space is very constrained (too much for us to learn anything interesting from the results)
 - The experimental results are good but underwhelming
 - Compared to e.g. Bayesian optimization methods, this approach seems very wasteful in compute resources (e.g. 1500 runs of training before the approach starts exploiting).

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a useful latent representation and model global structure well but have difficulty capturing small details. PixelCNN models details very well, but lacks a latent code and is difficult to scale for capturing large structures. We present PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN. Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64 × 64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.

153,B1gtu5ilg,Accept (Poster),Transfer of View-manifold Learning to Similarity Perception of Novel Objects,"We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.
","['Deep learning', 'Transfer Learning']","The paper proposes a model for multi-view learning that uses a triplet loss to encourage different views of the same object to be closer together then the views of two different objects.

155,SkkTMpjex,Accept (Poster),Distributed Second-Order Optimization using Kronecker-Factored Approximations,"As more computational resources become available, machine learning researchers train ever larger neural networks on millions of data points using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Although SGD scales well in terms of both the size of dataset and the number of parameters of the model, it has rapidly diminishing returns as parallel computing resources increase.  Second-order optimization methods have an affinity for well-estimated gradients and large mini-batches, and can therefore benefit much more from parallel computation in principle.   Unfortunately,  they often employ severe approximations to the curvature matrix in order to scale to large models with millions of parameters, limiting their effectiveness in practice versus well-tuned SGD with momentum.  The recently proposed K-FAC method(Martens and Grosse, 2015) uses a stronger and more sophisticated curvature approximation, and has been shown to make much more per-iteration progress than SGD, while only introducing a modest overhead.  In this paper, we develop a version of K-FAC that distributes the computation of gradients and additional quantities required by K-FAC across multiple machines, thereby taking advantage of method’s superior scaling to large mini-batches and mitigating its additional overheads. We provide a Tensorflow implementation of our approach which is easy to use and can be applied to many existing codebases without modification.  Additionally, we develop several algorithmic enhancements to K-FAC which can improve its computational performance for very large models. Finally, we show that our distributed K-FAC method speeds up training of various state-of-the-art ImageNet classification models by a factor of two compared to Batch Normalization(Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).","['Deep learning', 'Optimization']","All reviewers agreed that this is an interesting contribution, but all agreed that the testing environment was somewhat small-scale and that significant difficulties could arise is scaling it up.

In this work we formulate the navigation question as a reinforcement learning problem and show that data efficiency and task performance can be dramatically improved by relying on additional auxiliary tasks to bootstrap learning. In particular we consider jointly learning the goal-driven reinforcement learning problem with an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task. Using this approach we can learn to navigate from raw sensory input in complicated 3D mazes, approaching human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently. We provide detailed analysis of the agent behaviour, its ability to localise, and its network activity dynamics, that show that the agent implicitly learns key navigation abilities, with only sparse rewards and without direct supervision.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","The paper proposes an approach to navigating in complex environments using RL agents that have auxiliary tasks besides just the successful navigation itself (for instance, the task of predicting depth from images).

157,r1rz6U5lg,Accept (Poster),Learning to superoptimize programs,"  Code super-optimization is the task of transforming any given program to a more efficient version while preserving its input-output behaviour. In some sense, it is similar to the paraphrase problem from natural language processing where the intention is to change the syntax of an utterance without changing its semantics. Code-optimization has been the subject of years of research that has resulted in the development of rule-based transformation strategies that are used by compilers. More recently, however, a class of stochastic search based methods have been shown to outperform these strategies. This approach involves repeated sampling of modifications to the program from a proposal distribution, which are accepted or rejected based on whether they preserve correctness, and the improvement they achieve. These methods, however, neither learn from past behaviour nor do they try to leverage the semantics of the program under consideration. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel learning based approach for code super-optimization. Intuitively, our method works by learning the proposal distribution using unbiased estimators of the gradient of the expected improvement. Experiments on benchmarks comprising of automatically generated as well as existing (``Hacker's Delight'') programs show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform state of the art approaches for code super-optimization.

158,S1_pAu9xl,Accept (Poster),Trained Ternary Quantization,"Deep neural networks are widely used in machine learning applications. However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it’s as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16× smaller than full- precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04%, 0.16%, 0.36%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%.",['Deep learning'],The paper describes a method for training neural networks with ternary weights.

Instead of learning a single sequence model for the population (which does not account for variations within the population), we learn a set of basis sequence models based on different individuals.  The sequence of hidden states for a new individual is inferred in an online fashion by estimating a distribution over the basis models that best explain the sequence of observations of this new individual.  We explain how to do this in the context of hidden Markov models with Gaussian mixture models that are learned based on streaming data by online Bayesian moment matching.  The resulting transfer learning technique is demonstrated with three real-word applications: activity recognition based on smartphone sensors, sleep classification based on electroencephalography data and the prediction of the direction of future packet flows between a pair of servers in telecommunication networks.

The number of parameters in recent state-of-the-art networks makes them hard to deploy, especially on mobile phones and embedded devices. The challenge is due to both the size of the model and the time it takes to evaluate it. In order to deploy these RNNs efficiently, we propose a technique to reduce the parameters of a network by pruning weights during the initial training of the network. At the end of training, the parameters of the network are sparse while accuracy is still close to the original dense neural network. The network size is reduced by 8× and the time required to train the model remains constant. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to achieve better than baseline performance while still reducing the total number of parameters significantly. Pruning RNNs reduces the size of the model and can also help achieve significant inference time speed-up using sparse GEMMs. Benchmarks show that using our technique model size can be reduced by 90% and speed-up is around 2× to 7×.","['Speech', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","Here is a summary of the reviews:

They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size.

167,S1RP6GLle,Accept (Oral),Amortised MAP Inference for Image Super-resolution,"Image super-resolution (SR) is an underdetermined inverse problem, where a large number of plausible high resolution images can explain the same downsampled image. Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss.
However, the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Here we introduce new methods for \emph{amortised MAP inference} whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models. We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show that the GAN based approach performs best on real image data.

As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding.

169,HJpfMIFll,Accept (Poster),Geometry of Polysemy,"Vector representations of words have heralded a transformational approach to classical problems in NLP; the most popular example is word2vec. However, a single vector does not suffice to model the polysemous nature of many (frequent) words, i.e., words with multiple meanings.    In this paper, we propose a three-fold approach for unsupervised polysemy modeling: (a) context representations, (b) sense induction and disambiguation and (c) lexeme (as a word and sense pair) representations. A key feature of our work is the finding that  a sentence containing a target word is  well represented by a low-rank subspace,  instead of a point in a vector  space. We then show that the subspaces associated with a particular sense of the target word tend to intersect over a line (one-dimensional subspace), which we use to disambiguate senses using a  clustering algorithm that harnesses the Grassmannian geometry of the representations. The disambiguation algorithm, which we call $K$-Grassmeans, leads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the corpus -- yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner starting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English. Apart from several prototypical target (word,sense) examples and a host of empirical studies to intuit and justify  the various geometric representations,  we validate our algorithms on standard sense induction and disambiguation datasets and present new state-of-the-art results.",['Natural language processing'],The paper considers an important problem largely ignored by continuous word representation learning: polysemy.

In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small ``detector'' subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust.  We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack.

Recently, various methods for incorporating differentiable memory into these architectures have been proposed. When predicting the next token, these models query information from a memory of the recent history and thus can facilitate learning mid- and long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention models produce a single output vector per time step that is used for predicting the next token as well as the key and value of a differentiable memory of the history of tokens. In this paper, we propose a key-value attention mechanism that produces separate representations for the key and value of a memory, and for a representation that encodes the next-word distribution. This usage of past memories outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that it mainly utilizes past memory only of the previous five representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much simpler model which simply uses a concatenation of output representations from the previous three-time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented neural language models.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","Reviewers found this paper to be a rigorous and ""thorough experimental analysis"" of context-length in language modelingv through the lens of an ""interesting extension to standard attention mechanism"".

However, for many tasks we may want to model richer structural dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. In this work, we experiment with incorporating richer structural distributions, encoded using graphical models, within deep networks. We show that these structured attention networks are simple extensions of the basic attention procedure, and that they allow for extending attention  beyond the standard soft-selection approach, such as attending to partial segmentations or to subtrees. We experiment with two different classes of structured attention networks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing model, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural network layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for incorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform baseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference.

However, the gap between dropout’s training and inference phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce (approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard dropout training objective, resulting in an explicit control of the gap. Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently.","['Theory', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","This paper presents a theoretical underpinning of dropout, and uses this derivation to both characterize its properties and to extend the method.

This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers.

This has motivated researchers to design attentional models that can dynamically focus on parts of images or videos that are salient, e.g., by down-weighting irrelevant pixels. In this work, we propose a spatiotemporal attentional model that learns where to look in a video directly from human fixation data. We model visual attention with a mixture of Gaussians at each frame. This distribution is used to express the probability of saliency for each pixel. Time consistency in videos is modeled hierarchically by: 1) deep 3D convolutional features to represent spatial and short-term time relations and 2) a long short-term memory network on top that aggregates the clip-level representation of sequential clips and therefore expands the temporal domain from few frames to seconds. The parameters of the proposed model are optimized via maximum likelihood estimation using human fixations as training data, without knowledge of the action in each video. Our experiments on Hollywood2 show state-of-the-art performance on saliency prediction for video.

We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find that zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks.

They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black
box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters.
Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial
examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error
on clean inputs.
So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems.
In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet.
Our contributions include:
(1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets,
(2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods,
(3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack
      methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks,
      and
(4) resolution of a ``label leaking'' effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform
      better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial
      example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to
      exploit regularities in the construction process.

It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a  degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions---and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation.

Manual efforts to maintain these lists involve a great deal of tedious human labor, which could be reduced by computational tools to suggest likely missing or incorrect medications on a patient’s list. We report here an application of recurrent neural networks to predict the likely therapeutic classes of medications that a patient is taking, given a sequence of the last 100 billing codes in their record. Our best model was a GRU that achieved high prediction accuracy (micro-averaged AUC 0.93, Label Ranking Loss 0.076), limited by hardware constraints on model size.

However, the most prevalent regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between negatively correlated feature weights, allowing the regularizer to reach higher decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. 
In particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout are present. Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight space is constant compared to the feature map space. As a result, we are able to reduce the overfitting of state-of-the-art CNNs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning', 'Optimization']","The paper presents a new regularization approach for deep learning that penalizes positive correlations between features in a network.

This work presents new training and decoding methods that improve the quality, coherence, and diversity of long responses generated using sequence-to-sequence models. Our approach adds self-attention to the decoder to maintain coherence in longer responses, and we propose a practical approach, called the glimpse-model, for scaling to large datasets.

In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time.

We propose a new regularization method that minimizes the  domain-specific latent feature representations directly in the hidden activation space. Although some standard distribution matching approaches exist that can be interpreted as the matching of weighted sums of moments, e.g. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), an explicit order-wise matching of higher order moments has not been considered before.
We propose to match the higher order central moments of probability distributions by means of order-wise moment differences. Our model does not require computationally expensive distance and kernel matrix computations. We utilize the equivalent representation of probability distributions by moment sequences to define a new distance function, called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD). We prove that CMD is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval. We further prove that convergence of probability distributions on compact intervals w.r.t. the new metric implies convergence in distribution of the respective random variables.
We test our approach on two different benchmark data sets for object recognition (Office) and sentiment analysis of product reviews (Amazon reviews). CMD achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on most domain adaptation tasks of Office and outperforms networks trained with MMD, Variational Fair Autoencoders and Domain Adversarial Neural Networks on Amazon reviews.

Our implementation contains a number of modifications to the original model that both simplify its structure and improve its performance. 1) We use a discretized logistic mixture likelihood on the pixels, rather than a 256-way softmax, which we find to speed up training. 2) We condition on whole pixels, rather than R/G/B sub-pixels, simplifying the model structure. 3) We use downsampling to efficiently capture structure at multiple resolutions. 4) We introduce additional short-cut connections to further speed up optimization. 5) We regularize the model using dropout. Finally, we present state-of-the-art log likelihood results on CIFAR-10 to demonstrate the usefulness of these modifications.",[]," The authors acknowledge that the ideas in the paper are incremental, but assert these are not-trivial improvements upon prior work on pixel CNNs. The reviewers tended to agree with this characterization. The paper presents SOTA pixel likelihood results on CIFAR-10. This work is also coupled with a high quality source code contribution, which also appears to have already been well received by the github community. Reviewer 1 made the point that in terms of raw novelty this work is probably a little below the bar for an oral presentation. A public reviewer rated this paper as a strong accept. Given the statistics, quality and originality of the other papers in my AC batch I recommend poster."
202,SyQq185lg,Accept (Poster),Latent Sequence Decompositions,"Sequence-to-sequence models rely on a fixed decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens that may be words, word-pieces or characters. The choice of these tokens and the decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens is often static, and independent of the input, output data domains. This can potentially lead to a sub-optimal choice of token dictionaries, as the decomposition is not informed by the particular problem being solved. In this paper we present Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD), a framework in which the decomposition of sequences into constituent tokens is learnt during the training of the model. The decomposition depends both on the input sequence and on the output sequence. In LSD, during training, the model samples decompositions incrementally, from left to right by locally sampling between valid extensions. We experiment with the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task. Our LSD model achieves 12.9% WER compared to a character baseline of 14.8% WER. When combined with a convolutional network on the encoder, we achieve a WER of 9.6%.
","['Speech', 'Applications', 'Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","This work proposes a method for segmenting target generation sequence that is learned as part of the model. Generally all reviewers found this paper novel and interesting.
 
 Pros:
 - Quality: The paper is both containing ""with solid theoretically justified"" and ""present(s) nice improvements over character based result"". One reviewer asked for the ""the experimental study could be more solid.""
 - Impact: methods like ""BPE"" are now somewhat standard hacks in seq2seq modeling. This type of model could be potentially impactful at disrupting. 
 - Clarity: Reviewers found the work to be a ""clearly written paper"" 
 
 Cons:
 - Some of the reviewers were not as enthuthiastic about this work compared to other papers. There were several comments asking for further experimental results. However I found that the author's responses clearly explained these away and provided clear justificition for why they were not necessary, already included, or explained by previous results. I feel that this takes care of the major issues, and warrants a small raise in score."

Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs, for the purpose of developing new
machine learning-based theorem-proving strategies. We make this dataset

learning tasks that can be performed on this dataset, and discuss their
significance for theorem proving. We also benchmark a set of simple baseline
machine learning models suited for the tasks (including logistic regression
convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks). The results of our
baseline models show the promise of applying machine learning to HOL
theorem proving.
",[],"The paper presents a new dataset and initial machine-learning results for an interesting problem, namely, higher-order logic theorem proving. This dataset is of great potential value in the development of deep-learning approaches for (mathematical) reasoning.
 
 As a personal side note: It would be great if the camera-ready version of the paper would provide somewhat more context on how the state-of-the-art approaches in automatic theorem proving perform on the conjectures in HolStep. Also, it would be good to clarify how the dataset makes sure there is no ""overlap"" between the training and test set: for instance, a typical proof of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality employs the Pythagorean theorem: how can we be sure that we don't have Cauchy-Schwarz in the training set and Pythagoras in the test set?"
204,BJh6Ztuxl,Accept (Poster),Fine-grained Analysis of Sentence Embeddings Using Auxiliary Prediction Tasks,"There is a lot of research interest in encoding variable length sentences into fixed
length vectors, in a way that preserves the sentence meanings. Two common
methods include representations based on averaging word vectors, and representations based on the hidden states of recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs.
The sentence vectors are used as features for subsequent machine learning tasks
or for pre-training in the context of deep learning. However, not much is known
about the properties that are encoded in these sentence representations and about
the language information they capture.
We propose a framework that facilitates better understanding of the encoded representations. We define prediction tasks around isolated aspects of sentence structure (namely sentence length, word content, and word order), and score representations by the ability to train a classifier to solve each prediction task when
using the representation as input. We demonstrate the potential contribution of the
approach by analyzing different sentence representation mechanisms. The analysis sheds light on the relative strengths of different sentence embedding methods with respect to these low level prediction tasks, and on the effect of the encoded
vector’s dimensionality on the resulting representations.","['Natural language processing', 'Deep learning']","The area chair agrees with the reviewers and think this paper would be of interest to the ICLR audience. There is clearly more to be done in this area, but the authors do a good job shedding some light on what sentence embeddings can encode.

205,SkBsEQYll,Reject,Learning similarity preserving representations with neural similarity and context encoders,"We introduce similarity encoders (SimEc), which learn similarity preserving representations by using a feed-forward neural network to map data into an embedding space where the original similarities can be approximated linearly. The model can easily compute representations for novel (out-of-sample) data points, even if the original pairwise similarities of the training set were generated by an unknown process such as human ratings. This is demonstrated by creating embeddings of both image and text data.
Furthermore, the idea behind similarity encoders gives an intuitive explanation of the optimization strategy used by the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) word2vec model trained with negative sampling. Based on this insight, we define context encoders (ConEc), which can improve the word embeddings created with word2vec by using the local context of words to create out-of-vocabulary embeddings and representations for words with multiple meanings. The benefit of this is illustrated by using these word embeddings as features in the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition task.","['Natural language processing', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Supervised Learning']","There is consensus among the reviewers that the novelty of the paper is limited, and that the experimental evaluation of the proposed method needs to be improved."
206,SkJeEtclx,Reject,Memory-augmented Attention Modelling for Videos,"Recent works on neural architectures have demonstrated the utility of attention mechanisms for a wide variety of tasks. Attention models used for problems such as image captioning typically depend on the image under consideration, as well as the previous sequence of words that come before the word currently being generated. While these types of models have produced impressive results, they are not able to model the higher-order interactions involved in problems such as video description/captioning, where the relationship between parts of the video and the concepts being depicted is complex. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel memory-based attention model for video description. Our model utilizes memories of past attention when reasoning about where to attend to in the current time step, similar to the central executive system proposed in human cognition. This allows the model to not only reason about local attention more effectively, it allows it to consider the entire sequence of video frames while generating each word. Evaluation on the challenging and popular MSVD and Charades datasets show that the proposed architecture outperforms all previously proposed methods and leads to a new state of the art results in the video description.","['Deep learning', 'Multi-modal learning', 'Computer vision']","There appears to be consensus among the reviewers that the paper appears the overstate its contributions: the originality of the proposed temporal modeler (TEM) is limited, and the experimental evaluation (which itself is of good quality!) does not demonstrate clear merits of the TEM architecture.

However, in many applications such as healthcare, it is important to identify causal relationships between the inputs and the response variables to be able to change the response variables by intervention on the inputs. In pursuit of models whose predictive power comes maximally from causal variables, we propose a novel causal regularizer based on the independence of mechanisms assumption. We utilize the causal regularizer to steer deep neural network architectures towards causally-interpretable solutions. We perform a large-scale analysis of electronic health records. Employing expert's judgment as the causal ground-truth, we show that our causally-regularized algorithm outperforms its L1-regularized equivalence both in predictive performance as well as causal relevance. Finally, we show that the proposed causal regularizer can be used together with representation learning algorithms to yield up to 20% improvement in the causality score of the generated hypotheses.","['Deep learning', 'Applications']","The reviewers pointed out several issues with the paper, and all recommended rejection.

The source of these ineffectual computations is best understood in the context of conventional multipliers which generate internally multiple terms, that is, products of the multiplicand and powers of two, which added together produce the final product. At runtime, many of these terms are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, PRA calculates only the non-zero terms resulting in a design whose execution time for convolutional layers is ideally proportional to the number of activation bits that are 1. Measurements demonstrate that for the convolutional layers on Convolutional Neural Networks and during inference, PRA improves performance by 4.3x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator and by 4.5x when DaDN uses an 8-bit quantized representation. DaDN was reported to be 300x faster than commodity graphics processors.

210,Sywh5KYex,Reject,Learning Identity Mappings with Residual Gates,"We propose a layer augmentation technique that adds shortcut connections with a linear gating mechanism, and can be applied to almost any network model. By using a scalar parameter to control each gate, we provide a way to learn identity mappings by optimizing only one parameter. We build upon the motivation behind Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks, where a layer is reformulated in order to make learning identity mappings less problematic to the optimizer. The augmentation introduces only one extra parameter per layer, and provides easier optimization by making degeneration into identity mappings simpler. Experimental results show that augmenting layers provides better optimization, increased performance, and more layer independence. We evaluate our method on MNIST using fully-connected networks, showing empirical indications that our augmentation facilitates the optimization of deep models, and that it provides high tolerance to full layer removal: the model retains over 90% of its performance even after half of its layers have been randomly removed. In our experiments, augmented plain networks -- which can be interpreted as simplified Highway Neural Networks -- outperform ResNets, raising new questions on how shortcut connections should be designed. We also evaluate our model on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using augmented Wide ResNets, achieving 3.65% and 18.27% test error, respectively.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning', 'Optimization']","Although this was a borderline paper, the reviewers ultimately concluded that, given how easy it would be for a practitioner to independently devise the methodological trick of the paper, the paper did not demonstrate that the idea was sufficiently useful to merit acceptance."

Using negative tour length as the reward signal, we optimize the parameters of the recurrent neural network using a policy gradient method. We compare learning the network parameters on a set of training graphs against learning them on individual test graphs. Without much engineering and heuristic designing, Neural Combinatorial Optimization achieves close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes. Applied to the KnapSack, another NP-hard problem, the same method obtains optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items.

In the end though, even after these consideration, none of the reviewers strongly supported the work and all of them expressed some reservations. 
 
 Pros:
 - All agree that the work is extremely clear, going as far as saying the work is ""very well written"" and ""easy to understand"". 
 - Generally there was a predisposition to support the work for its originality particularly due to its ""methodological contributions"", and even going so far as a saying it would generally be a natural accept.
 
 Cons:
 - There was a very uncommonly strong backlash to the claims made by the paper, particularly the first draft, but even upon revisions. One reviewer even saying this was an ""excellent example of hype-generation far before having state-of-the-art results"" and that it was ""doing a disservice to our community since it builds up an expectation that the field cannot live up to"" . This does not seem to be an isolated reviewer, but a general feeling across the reviews. Another faulting ""the toy-ness of the evaluation metric"" and the way the comparisons were carried out.
 - A related concern was a feeling that the body of work in operations research was not fully taken account in this work, noting ""operations research literature is replete with a large number of benchmark problems that have become standard to compare solver quality"".

213,SyEiHNKxx,Invite to Workshop Track,A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics,"One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers. Currently, robots are often treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. When gradient-based methods are used, models are kept small or rely on finite difference approximations for the Jacobian. This method quickly grows expensive with increasing numbers of parameters, such as found in deep learning. We propose an implementation of a modern physics engine, which can differentiate control parameters. This engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU. Firstly, this paper shows how such an engine speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems. Furthermore, it explains why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Finally, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software.",['Deep learning'],"Originality, significance:
  The paper implements a physics-based simulator directly using Theano. This avoids the type of finite differentiation that physics engines such as MuJoCo use to compute derivatives. It is quite an interesting idea, and is demonstrated using learned control for several models.

  The original version was somewhat loosely written; the current version is improved.
 
 Pros:
 - The nice idea of implementing a physics engine in a language such as Theano, and showing that this is quite feasible.
 - May inspire further work in this direction.
 
 Cons:
 - The speed is not systematically evaluated, as compared to finite-difference-based engines. It is thought to be ""in the same ballpark"" as other more full-featured engines. It is not clear that those using simulators will care whether it uses the true derivatives or finite differences."

Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable probability density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of variational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD to maximize its convergence speed, significantly outperforming the hand-designed step size schemes.",['Theory'],"This paper is both time and topical in that it forms part of the growing and important literature of ways of representing approximate posterior distributions for variational inference that do need need a known or tractable density.

We define the concept of sample importance as the change in parameters induced by a sample. In this paper, we explored the sample importance in training deep neural networks using stochastic gradient descent. We found that ""easy"" samples -- samples that are correctly and confidently classified at the end of the training -- shape parameters closer to the output, while the ""hard"" samples impact parameters closer to the input to the network. Further, ""easy"" samples are relevant in the early training stages, and ""hard"" in the late training stage. Further, we show that constructing batches which contain samples of comparable difficulties tends to be a poor strategy compared to maintaining a mix of both hard and easy samples in all of the batches. Interestingly, this contradicts some of the results on curriculum learning which suggest that ordering training examples in terms of difficulty can lead to better performance.","['Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","The reviewers provided detailed, confident reviews and there was significant discussion between the parties.

 - Dependence of the criteria on the learning rate (this does not make sense to me); and
 - Really really poor results on CIFAR-10 (and this is not being too picky, like asking them to be state-of-the-art; they are just way off)

We show that with or without nonlinearities, by adding shortcuts that have depth two, the condition number of the Hessian of the loss function at the zero initial point is depth-invariant, which makes training very deep models no more difficult than shallow ones. Shortcuts of higher depth result in an extremely flat (high-order) stationary point initially, from which the optimization algorithm is hard to escape. The 1-shortcut, however, is essentially equivalent to no shortcuts. Extensive experiments are provided accompanying our theoretical results. We show that initializing the network to small weights with 2-shortcuts achieves significantly better results than random Gaussian (Xavier) initialization, orthogonal initialization, and shortcuts of deeper depth, from various perspectives ranging from final loss, learning dynamics and stability, to the behavior of the Hessian along the learning process.","['Deep learning', 'Optimization', 'Theory']","This paper endeavors to offer theoretical explanations of the performance of ResNet.

Though dropout can preserve the expected input to a neuron between train and test, the variance of the input differs. We thus propose a new weight initialization by correcting for the influence of dropout rates and an arbitrary nonlinearity's influence on variance through simple corrective scalars. Since Batch Normalization trained with dropout estimates the variance of a layer's incoming distribution with some inputs dropped, the variance also differs between train and test. After training a network with Batch Normalization and dropout, we simply update Batch Normalization's variance moving averages with dropout off and obtain state of the art on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 without data augmentation.",[],"This was a borderline paper. However, no reviewers were willing to champion the acceptance of the paper during the deliberation period.

The second network is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a  top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed signal. The maximum likelihood training algorithms of both the descriptor net and the generator net are in the form of alternating back-propagation, and both algorithms involve Langevin sampling.

 The most negative reviewer notes the following pros and cons:
 
 Pro: 
 + Incorporating general musical knowledge into the learned network is a good idea and non-trivial. 
 + Idea to introduce a behavioral measure for the quality of the generated samples is useful, as music is very subjective. 
 + The multitrack idea seems useful and a clear step beyond Magenta as far as I understand. 
 
 Con:

223,HJ9rLLcxg,Invite to Workshop Track,Dataset Augmentation in Feature Space,"Dataset augmentation, the practice of applying a wide array of domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed, implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.
",['Unsupervised Learning'],"This paper proposes to regularize neural networks by adding synthetic data created by interpolating or extrapolating in an abstract feature space, learning by an autoencoder.
 
 The main idea is sensible, and clearly presented and motivated. Overall this paper is a good contribution. However, the idea seems unlikely to have much impact for two reasons:
  - It's unclear when we should expect this method to help vs hurt
  - Relatedly, the method has a number of hyperparameters that it's unclear how to set except by cross-validation.
 
 We also want to remark that other regularization methods effectively already do closely related things. Dropout, gradient noise, and Bayesian methods, for instance, effectively produce 'synthetic data' in a similar way when the high-level weights of the network are perturbed."
224,BJC8LF9ex,Reject,Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values,"Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.",['Deep learning'],"This paper presents a modification of GRU-RNNs to handle missing data explicitly, allowing them to exploit data not missing at random. The method is presented clearly enough, but the reviewers felt that the claims were overreaching. It's also unsatisfying that the method depends on specific modifications of RNN architectures for a particular domain, instead of being a more general approach."

On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. We explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human approach, and introduce Coconet, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models. Despite ostensibly sampling from the same distribution as the NADE ancestral sampling procedure, we find that a blocked Gibbs approach significantly improves sample quality. We provide evidence that this is due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from Yao et al. (2014) yields better samples than ancestral sampling. We demonstrate the versatility of our method on unconditioned polyphonic music generation.","['Deep learning', 'Applications', 'Unsupervised Learning']","This paper applies an existing idea (Yao's block Gibbs sampling of NADE) to a music model.

Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) can be seen asan optimal kernel decomposition, nevertheless it requires large amount of trainingdata to learn its kernels.  We propose a trade-off between these two approaches: a Chirplet kernel as an efficient Q constant bioacoustic representation to pretrainCNN. First we motivate Chirplet bioinspired auditory representation. Second we give the first algorithm (and code) of a Fast Chirplet Transform (FCT). Third, we demonstrate the computation efficiency of FCT on large environmental data base: months of Orca recordings, and 1000 Birds species from the LifeClef challenge. Fourth, we validate FCT on the vowels subset of the Speech TIMIT dataset. The results show that FCT accelerates CNN when it pretrains low level layers: it reduces training duration by -28% for birds classification, and by -26% for vowels classification. Scores are also enhanced by FCT pretraining, with a relative gain of +7.8% of Mean Average Precision on birds,  and +2.3% of vowel accuracy against raw audio CNN. We conclude on perspectives on tonotopic FCT deep machine listening, and inter-species bioacoustic transfer learning to generalise the representation of animal communication systems.","['Applications', 'Supervised Learning', 'Deep learning', 'Speech']","This paper studies efficient signal representations to perform bioacoustic classification based on CNNs. Contrary to image classification, where most useful information can be extracted with spatially localized kernels, bioacoustic signatures are more localized in the frequency domain, requiring to rethink the design of convolutional architectures. The authors propose to enforce the lower layers of the architecture with chirplet transforms, which are localized in the time-frequency plane as wavelets, but with time-varying central frequency. They present preliminary numerical experiments showing promising improvements over existing baselines. 
 
 The reviewers found interest in the method, but raised concerns on the relatively narrow scope of the method, as well as the clarity and rigor of the presentation. Whereas the first concern is up to debate, I agree that the paper currently suffers from poor english which affects its clarity. 
 
 Despite these concerns, the AC finds the contribution useful in the broader context of inductive bias and injecting priors in neural networks. This is an example where the inductive priors that work well on images (localized convolutions rather than generic fully connected layers) are not sufficient unless given massive amounts of data.

However current approaches suffer from two shortcomings. First, the encoders compute a representation of each word taking into account only the history of the words it has read so far, yielding suboptimal representations. Second, current models utilize large vocabularies in order to minimize the problem of unknown words, resulting in slow decoding times and large storage costs. In this paper we address both shortcomings. Towards this goal, we first introduce a simple mechanism that first reads the input sequence before committing to a representation of each word.

Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates internal rewards and values over multiple planning depths. 
The predictron is trained end-to-end so as to make these accumulated values accurately approximate the true value function, thereby focusing the model upon the aspects of the environment most relevant to planning. We applied the predictron to procedurally generated random mazes and a simulator for the game of pool. The predictron yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional deep neural network architectures.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Supervised Learning', 'Semi-Supervised Learning']","There is potential here for a great paper, unfortunately in its current form there is too deep of a disconnect between the framing and promise of the presentation, and the empirical validation actually delivered by the experiments.

In Neural Data Filter, the whole training process of the original neural network is monitored and supervised by a deep reinforcement network, which controls whether to filter some data in sequentially arrived mini-batches so as to maximize future accumulative reward (e.g., validation accuracy). The SGD process accompanied with NDF is able to use less data and converge faster while achieving comparable accuracy as the standard SGD trained on the full dataset.

232,Bk8aOm9xl,Invite to Workshop Track,Surprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques. 
",['Reinforcement Learning'],"The paper proposes an intuitive method for exploration, namely to build a model of the system dynamics and explore regions where this approximation differs from the observed data (i.e., how ""surprised"" the agent was by an observation). The idea is a nice one, and part of the benefit comes from the simplicity and wide applicability of the approach.
 
 The main drawback of this paper is simply that the resulting approach doesn't substantially outperform existing approaches, at least not to a degree where it seem like the paper should should be clearly accepted to ICLR. On the continuous control tasks, the advantage over VIME seems very unclear (at best the results are mixed, showing sometimes surprisal and sometime VIME do better), and on the Atari games no comparison is made against many of the methods tuned for this setting, such as Gorila (Nair, 2015) which achieves some of the best results we are aware of on the Venture game, which is definitely the strongest result in this current paper, but not as good as this previous work. We know the settings are different, but overall it seems like the approach is largely outperformed by existing approaches, and thus the advantage mainly comes from runtime. This is certainly an interesting take, but needs to be studied a lot more thoroughly before it would make a really compelling case. We would like to recomend this paper to the workshop track. The pros/cons are as follows:
 
 Pros:
 + Simple and intuitive method for exploration
 
 Cons:
 - Doesn't seem to substantially outperform existing methods
 - No comparison to many alternative approaches for some of the ""better"" results in the paper."

234,ryjp1c9xg,Reject,Extensions and Limitations of the Neural GPU,"The Neural GPU is a recent model that can learn algorithms such as multi-digit binary addition and binary multiplication in a way that generalizes to inputs of arbitrary length.  We show that there are two simple ways of improving the performance of the Neural GPU: by carefully designing a curriculum, and by increasing model size.  The latter requires a memory efficient implementation, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory intensive.  We find that these techniques increase the set of algorithmic problems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to perform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long numbers) when the arguments are given in the decimal representation (which, surprisingly, has not been possible before). We have also been able to train the Neural GPU to evaluate long arithmetic expressions with multiple operands that require respecting the  precedence order of the operands, although these have succeeded only in their binary representation, and not with perfect accuracy.

In addition, we gain insight into the Neural GPU by investigating its failure modes.  We find that Neural GPUs that correctly generalize to arbitrarily long numbers still fail to compute the correct answer on highly-symmetric, atypical inputs: for  example, a Neural GPU that achieves near-perfect generalization on decimal multiplication of up to 100-digit long numbers can fail on $000000\dots002 \times 000000\dots002$ while succeeding at $2 \times 2$.  These failure modes are reminiscent of adversarial examples.",[],"This paper is clearly written, and contains original observations on the properties of the neural GPU model. These observations are an important part of research, and sharing them (and code) will help the field move forward. However, these observations do not quite add up to a coherent story, nor is a particular set of hypotheses explored in depth. So the main problem with this paper is that it doesn't fit the 'one main idea' standard format of papers, making it hard to build on this work.
 
 The other big problem with this paper is the lack of comparison to similar architectures. There is lots of intuition given about why the NGPU should work better than other architectures in some situations, but not much empirical validation of this idea."

We specifically address the problem of automatically discovering options in decision processes. We describe a new RL learning framework called Bi-POMDP, and a new learning model called Budgeted Option Neural Network (BONN) able to discover options based on a budgeted learning objective. Since Bi-POMDP are more general than POMDP, our model can also be used to discover options for classical RL tasks. The BONN model is evaluated on different classical RL problems, demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative interesting results.",['Reinforcement Learning'],"Most of the reviewers agreed that the proposed budgeted options framework was interesting, but there were a number of serious concerns raised about the work. Many of the reviewers found the assumptions of the approach to be somewhat odd, and while the particular formulation in the paper was generally assessed as novel, it has connections to a number of previous works that were not explored in detail.

The vanishing or exploding gradient problem is a well known issue associated with these challenges. One approach to addressing vanishing and exploding gradients is to use either soft or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to encourage or enforce orthogonality. Orthogonal matrices preserve gradient norm during backpropagation and can therefore be a desirable property; however, we find that hard constraints on orthogonality can negatively affect the speed of convergence and model performance. This paper explores the issues of optimization convergence, speed and gradient stability using a variety of different methods for encouraging or enforcing orthogonality. In particular we propose a weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy through which we we can bound matrix norms and therein control the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation.",['Deep learning'],"The work explores a very interesting way to deal with the problem of propagating information through RNNs. I think the approach looks promising but the reviewers point out that the experimental evaluation is a bit lacking.

237,B1vRTeqxg,Invite to Workshop Track,Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions,"The question of how procedural knowledge is represented and inferred is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Recent work on program induction has proposed neural architectures, based on abstractions like stacks, Turing machines, and interpreters,  that operate on abstract computational machines or on execution traces. But the recursive abstraction that is central to procedural knowledge is perhaps most naturally represented by symbolic representations that have syntactic structure, such as logical expressions and source code. Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation  on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures.
",['Deep learning'],"As part of this meta-review, I read the paper and found some surprising claims, such as the somewhat poorly motivated claim that coercing the output of a sub-network be a unit vector my dividing it by its L2 norm is close to layer normalisation which is mathematically almost true, if the mean of of the activations is 0, and we accept a fixed offset in the calculation of the stddev, but conceptually a different form of normalisation. It is also curious that other methods of obtaining stable training in recursive networks, such as TreeLSTM (Zhu et al. 2015, Tai et al. 2015), were not compared to. None of these problems is particularly damning but it is slightly disappointing not to see these issues discussed in the review process.

Overall, the reviews, which I found superficial in comparison to the other papers I am chairing, found the method proposed here sound, although some details lacked explanation. The consensus was that the general problem being addressed is interesting and timely, given the attention the topics of program induction and interpretation have been receiving in the community recently. There was also consensus that the setting the model was evaluated on was far too simple and unnatural, and that there is need for a more complex, task involving symbolic interpretation to validate the model. It is hard to tell, given all the design decisions made (l2-normalisation vs layer norm, softmax not working), whether the end product is tailored to the task at hand, and whether it will tell us something useful about how this approach generalises. I am inclined, on the basis of the reviewer's opinions of the setting and my own concerns outlined above, to recommend redirection to the workshop track."

The prior works use a coefficient to adjust the overall learning of the lexicons. They regard the paraphrases equally. 
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that regards the paraphrases diversely to alleviate the adverse effects of polysemy. We annotate each paraphrase with a degree of reliability. The paraphrases are randomly eliminated according to the degrees when our model learns word representations. In this way, our approach drops the unreliable paraphrases, keeping more reliable paraphrases at the same time. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the word vectors.

However, in terms of the ICLR audience, I simply don't believe there is enough here to warrant substantial interest. As an example, the authors highlighted the distinction between network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and felt that one review was completely unsuitable because they didn't realize this distinction when reading the paper. This is of course a crucial distinction from the security application side, but from the algorithmic/ML side, it's simply not that important, and the fact that there _has_ been previous work exactly on LSTMs for NIDS makes this paper unlikely to have a huge impact in the ICLR community. It would be much better suited to a security conference, where the application could be judged on its own merits, and the community would likely understand much better how significant these results were.

In this paper, we consider RL tasks defined as a sequence of high-level instructions described by natural language and study two types of generalization: to unseen and longer sequences of previously seen instructions, and to sequences where the instructions themselves were previously not seen. 
We present a novel hierarchical deep RL architecture that consists of two interacting neural controllers: a meta controller that reads instructions and repeatedly communicates subtasks to a subtask controller that in turn learns to perform such subtasks. To generalize better to unseen instructions, we propose a regularizer that encourages to learn subtask embeddings that capture correspondences between similar subtasks.

245,HkvS3Mqxe,Reject,Coarse Pruning of Convolutional Neural Networks with Random Masks,"The learning capability of a neural network improves with increasing depth at
higher computational costs. Wider layers with dense kernel connectivity patterns
further increase this cost and may hinder real-time inference. We propose feature
map and kernel level pruning for reducing the computational complexity of
a deep convolutional neural network. Pruning feature maps reduces the width
of a layer and hence does not need any sparse representation. Further, kernel
pruning changes the dense connectivity pattern into a sparse one. Due to coarse
nature, these pruning granularities can be exploited by GPUs and VLSI based
implementations. We propose a simple strategy to choose the least adversarial
pruning masks. The proposed approach is generic and can select good pruning
masks for feature map, kernel and intra-kernel pruning. The pruning masks are
generated randomly, and the best performing one is selected using the evaluation
set. The sufficient number of random pruning masks to try depends on the pruning
ratio, and is around 100 when 40% complexity reduction is needed. The pruned
network is retrained to compensate for the loss in accuracy. We have extensively
evaluated the proposed approach with the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets.
Experiments with the CIFAR-10 dataset show that more than 85% sparsity can be
induced in the convolution layers with less than 1% increase in the misclassification

We observe two main classes, a Gumbel-like distribution that appears in Google searches, human decision times, QR factorization and spin glasses, and a Gaussian-like distribution that appears in conjugate gradient method, deep network with MNIST input data and deep network with random input data. This empirical evidence suggests presence of a class of distributions for which the halting time is independent of the underlying distribution under some conditions.",['Optimization'],My overall conclusion is that the paper needs more work to be sufficiently convincing.

Modelling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Bayesian DNNs that use dropout-based variational distributions and scale to complex tasks have recently been proposed. We evaluate Bayesian DNNs trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units (dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We compare these Bayesian DNNs ability to represent their uncertainty about their outputs through sampling during inference. We tested the calibration of these Bayesian fully connected and convolutional DNNs on two visual inference tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). By adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the test images, we assessed how these DNNs represented their uncertainty about regions of input space not covered by the training set. These Bayesian DNNs represented their own uncertainty more accurately than traditional DNNs with a softmax output. We find that sampling of weights, whether Gaussian or Bernoulli, led to more accurate representation of uncertainty compared to sampling of units. However, sampling units using either Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to increased convolutional neural network (CNN) classification accuracy. Based on these findings we use both Bernoulli dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which approximates the use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution. We find that networks with spike-and-slab sampling combine the advantages of the other methods: they classify with high accuracy and robustly represent the uncertainty of their classifications for all tested architectures.","['Deep learning', 'Theory', 'Applications']",The reviewers unanimously recommend rejecting this paper.

 The reviewers agreed that this is a very promising line of work and acknowledged the effort of the authors to improve their paper after the initial discussion phase.

 In light of these reviews, the AC invites their work to the workshop track. 
 Also, I would like to emphasize an aspect of this work that I think should be addressed in the subsequent revision.
 
 As the authors rightfully show (thm 2.1), permutation equivariance puts very strong constraints in the class of 1-layer networks. This theorem, while rigorous, reflects a simple algebraic property of matrices that commute with permutation matrices. It is therefore not very surprising, and the resulting architecture relatively obvious. So much so that it already exists in the literature. In fact, it is a particular instance of the graph neural network model of Scarselli et al. '09 (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4700287/) when you consider a complete graph, which has been used in the setup of full set equivariance for example in 'Learning Multiagent communication with backpropagation', Sukhbaatar et al NIPS'16; see also 'Order Matters: sequence to sequence for sets', Vinyals et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06391. 
 The general question of how to model point-cloud data, or more generally data defined over graphs, with neural networks is progressing rapidly; see for example https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08097 for a recent survey.
 
 The question then is what is the contribution of the present work relative to this line of work. The authors should answer this question explicitly in the revised manuscript, either with a new application of the model, or with theory that advances our understanding of these models, or with new numerical applications."

In this paper, we introduce Exponential Machines (ExM), a predictor that models all interactions of every order. The key idea is to represent an exponentially large tensor of parameters in a factorized format called Tensor Train (TT). The Tensor Train format regularizes the model and lets you control the number of underlying parameters. To train the model, we develop a stochastic Riemannian optimization procedure, which allows us to fit tensors with 2^160 entries. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data with high-order interactions and that it works on par with high-order factorization machines on a recommender system dataset MovieLens 100K.","['Supervised Learning', 'Optimization']","Modeling nonlinear interactions between variables by imposing Tensor-train structure on parameter matrices is certainly an elegant and novel idea.

254,S1OufnIlx,Invite to Workshop Track,Adversarial examples in the physical world,"Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples.
An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified
very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier
to misclassify it.
In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does
not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake.
Adversarial examples pose security concerns
because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no
access to the underlying model.
Up to now, all previous work has assumed a threat model in which the adversary can
feed data directly into the machine learning classifier.
This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world,
for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as input.
This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable
to adversarial examples.
We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from a cell-phone camera
to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system.
We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly
even when perceived through the camera.","['Supervised Learning', 'Computer vision']","This paper studies an interesting aspect of adversarial training with important practical applications: its robustness against transformations that correspond to physical world constraints.

However, translation is just one of a myriad of useful spatial transformations. Can the same efficiency be attained when considering other spatial invariances? Such generalized convolutions have been considered in the past, but at a high computational cost. We present a construction that is simple and exact, yet has the same computational complexity that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists of a constant image warp followed by a simple convolution, which are standard blocks in deep learning toolboxes. With a carefully crafted warp, the resulting architecture can be made equivariant to a wide range of 2-parameters spatial transformations. We show encouraging results in realistic scenarios, including the estimation of vehicle poses in the Google Earth dataset (rotation and scale), and face poses in Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (3D rotations under perspective).",[],"The reviewers found the idea interesting and practical but had concerns about the novelty of the approach and the claims and theory presented in the paper. In particular, it seems that the reviewers feel that the authors' claim to present novel theory is unjustified (i.e. the theorems presented are not novel). Also claims regarding the advantages of this approach relative to related literature (in particular Dieleman et al. and Cohen & Welling) seem to be unsubstantiated.

Deep neural network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit unprecedented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization ability: new visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous learning. Biological vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also accurate and general-purpose. Is it possible that these different learning regimes converge to similar problem-dependent optimal computations? We therefore asked whether the human system-level computation of visual perception has DNN correlates and considered several anecdotal test cases. We found that perceptual sensitivity to image changes has DNN mid-computation correlates, while sensitivity to segmentation, crowding and shape has DNN end-computation correlates. Our results quantify the applicability of using DNN computation to estimate perceptual loss, and are consistent with the fascinating theoretical view that properties of human perception are a consequence of architecture-independent visual learning.","['Computer vision', 'Transfer Learning']","I think the reviewers evaluated this paper very carefully and were well balanced. The reviewers all agree that the presented comparison between human vision and DNNs is interesting. At the same time, none of the reviewers would strongly defend the paper.

We show that binary paragraph vectors outperform autoencoder-based binary codes, despite using fewer bits. We also evaluate their precision in transfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that binary paragraph vectors can capture semantics relevant for various domain-specific documents.

Different from existing work where basic morphing types on the layer level were addressed, we target at the central problem of network morphism at a higher level, i.e., how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module of a neural network. To simplify the representation of a network, we abstract a module as a graph with blobs as vertices and convolutional layers as edges, based on which the morphing process is able to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing operations are introduced to compose the graphs, based on which modules are classified into two families, i.e., simple morphable modules and complex modules. We present practical morphing solutions for both of these two families, and prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the state-of-the-art ResNet on benchmark datasets, and the effectiveness of the proposed solution has been verified.","['Deep learning', 'Computer vision']","The paper investigates the problem of morphing one convolutional network into another with application to exploring the model space (starting from a pre-trained baseline model). The resulting morphed models perform better than the baseline, albeit at the cost of more parameters and training. Importantly, it has not been demonstrated that morphing leads to training time speed-up, which is an important factor to consider when exploring new architectures starting from pre-trained models. Still, the presented approach and the experiments would be of interest to the community, so I recommend the paper for workshop presentation."
260,HyecJGP5ge,Reject,NEUROGENESIS-INSPIRED DICTIONARY LEARNING: ONLINE MODEL ADAPTION IN A CHANGING WORLD,"In this paper, we focus on online representation learning in non-stationary environments which may require continuous adaptation of model’s architecture. We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the “neuronal birth” is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. “Neuronal death” is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we identify certain properties of the data (e.g., sparse inputs with nearly non-overlapping supports) and of the model (e.g., dictionary sparsity) associated with such improvements.","['Unsupervised Learning', 'Computer vision', 'Transfer Learning', 'Optimization', 'Applications']","This paper combines simple heuristics to adapt the size of a dictionary during learning. The heuristics are intuitive: augmenting the dictionary size when correlation between reconstruction and inputs falls below a certain pre-determined threshold, reducing the dictionary size by adding a group-sparsity L1,2 penalty on the overall dictionary (the L1,2 penalty for pruning models had appeared elsewhere before, as the authors acknowledge).
 The topic of online adjustment of model complexity is an important one, and work like this is an interesting and welcome direction. The simplicity of the heuristics presented here would be appealing if there was more empirical support to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed adaptation. However, the empirical validation falls short here:
 - the claim that this work offers more than existing off-line model adaptation methods because of its online setting is the crux of the value of the paper, but the experimental validation does not offer much in terms of how to adjust hyperparameters to a truly nonstationary setting. Here, the hyperparameters are set rather arbitrarily, and the experimental setting is a single switch between two datasets (where off-line methods would do well), so this obscures the challenges that would be presented by a less artificial level of non-stationarity
 - an extensive set of experiments is presented, but all these experiments are confined in a strange experimental setting that is divorced from any practical metrics: the ""state-of-the-art"" method of reference is Mairal et al 2009 which was focused on speeding learning of dictionaries. Here, the metrics offered are correlation / reconstruction error, and classification, over full images instead of patches as is usually done for large images, without justification. This unnecessarily puts the work in a vacuum in terms of evaluation and comparison to existing art. In fact, the reconstructions in the appendix Fig. 17 and 18 look pretty bad, and the classification performance 1) does not demonstrate superiority of the method over standard dictionary learning (both lines are within the error bars and virtually indistinguishable if using more than 60 elements, which is not much), 2) performance overall is pretty bad for a 2-class discrimination task, again because of the unusual setting of using full images.
 In summary, this paper could be a very nice paper if the ideas were validated in a way that shows true usefulness and true robustness to the challenges of realistic nonstationarity, but this is unfortunately not the case here.
 Ps: two recent papers that could be worth mentioning in terms of model adaptation are diversity networks for pruning neurons (Diversity Networks, Mariet and Sra ICLR 2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05077), and augmenting neural networks with extra parameters while retaining previous learning (Progressive Neural Networks, Rusu et al 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671v3.pdf)."

We observe that these ""Passthrough Networks"" architectures enable the decoupling of the network state size from the number of parameters of the network, a possibility that is exploited in some recent works but not thoroughly explored. In this work we propose simple, yet effective, low-rank and low-rank plus diagonal matrix parametrizations for Passthrough Networks which exploit this decoupling property, reducing the data complexity and memory requirements of the network while preserving its memory capacity.

Here, we develop  our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models---models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data---and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding  in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.",['Unsupervised Learning'],"This paper provides a unifying review of various forms of generative model.

There exist many problem domains where intelligibility of the network model is crucial for deployment. Here we introduce a recurrent architecture composed of input-switched affine transformations, in other words an RNN without any nonlinearity and with one set of weights per input.
We show that this architecture achieves near identical performance to traditional architectures on language modeling of Wikipedia text, for the same number of model parameters. 
It can obtain this performance with the potential for computational speedup compared to existing methods, by precomputing the composed affine transformations corresponding to longer input sequences. 
As our architecture is affine, we are able to understand the mechanisms by which it functions using linear methods. For example, we show how the network linearly combines contributions from the past to make predictions at the current time step. We show how representations for words can be combined in order to understand how context is transferred across word boundaries.

This paper reduces the computational complexity of the CNNs by minimizing an objective function, including the recognition loss that is augmented with a sparsity-promoting penalty term. The sparsity structure of the network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of the corresponding objective functions. In particular, we take advantage of the separability of the sparsity-inducing penalty functions to decompose the minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. Applying our method to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN models, our proposed method is able to simplify the original model, generating models with less computation and fewer parameters, while maintaining and often improving generalization performance. Accomplishments on a variety of models strongly verify that our proposed ADMM-based method can be a very useful tool for simplifying and improving deep CNNs.

 - Simple algorithmic description using well-known ADMM method. 
 - Consistent performance gains in small and mid-scale object classification problems. 
 
 Cons:
 - Lack of significance in light of current literature on the topic. 
 - Lack of numerical experiments on large-scale classification problems and/or other tasks.
 - Lack of clarity when reporting speedup gains. 
 
 Based on these assessments, the AC recommends rejection. Since this decision is not 100% aligned 
 with the reviewers, let me expand on the reasons why I recommend rejection. 
 
 This paper presents a sound algorithm that sparsifies the weights of a trained-CNN, and it shows that 
 the resulting pruned network works well, better than the original one. A priori, this is a solid result. 
 My main problem is that this contribution has to be taken in the context of the already large body of 
 literature addressing this same question, starting from the seminal 'Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning', by Misha Denil et al., NIPS 2013, which is surprisingly ignored in the bibliography here; and onwards with 'Exploiting linear structure within convolutional networks for efficient evaluation', Denton et al, NIPS'14 (also ignored) and 'Speeding up convolutional neural networks with low rank expansions', Jadergerg et al., '14. These and many other works culminated in two recent papers, 'Deep Compression', by Han et al, ICLR'16 and 'Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks' by Wen et al, NIPS'16.
 Several reviewers pointed out that comparisons with Wen et al were needed; the authors of the present submission now do cite this work, but do not compare their results quantitatively and do not present the reader with compelling reasons to choose their acceleration instead of Wen et al.'s. Moreover, they mention in the rebuttal that the paper was published after the submission, but the work was available on the arxiv well before the ICLR deadline (august 2016). Wen's paper presents (i) source code, (ii) experiments on imagenet, (iii) 3x to 5x speedups in both CPU and GPU, and (iv) accuracy improvements on Cifar of ~1.5%. As far as I can see, the present submission presents none of these. Further compression factors were obtained in 'Deep Compression', also in large-scale models. 
 
 In light of these results, the authors should present more compelling evidence (in this case, since this is an experimental paper, empirical evidence in the form of higher accuracy and/or larger speedups/gains) as to why should a practitioner use their model, rather than simply presenting the differences between the approaches."

Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly, and at level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training, an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation.","['Natural language processing', 'Applications']","Noting the authors' concern about one of the reviewers, I read the paper myself and offer my own brief review.
 
 Evaluation is an extremely important question that does not get enough attention in the machine learning community, so the authors' effort is welcomed. The task that the authors are trying to evaluate is especially hard; in fact, it is not even clear to me how humans make these judgments. The low kappa scores on some of the non-""overall"" dimensions, and only moderate agreement on ""overall,"" are quite worrisome. What makes a good ""chat"" dialogue? The authors seem not to have qualitatively grappled with this key question, rather defining it empirically as ""whatever our human judges think it is."" This is, I think the deepest flaw of the work; the authors are rushing to automate evaluation without taking the time to ponder what good performance actually is. 
 
 That aside, I think the idea of automatic evaluation as a modeling problem is worth studying. The authors note that this has been done for other problems, such as machine translation. They give only a cursory discussion of this prior work, however, and miss the seminal reference, ""Regression for sentence-level MT evaluation with pseudo references,"" Albrecht, Joshua, and Rebecca Hwa, ACL 2007.
 
 The paper would be much stronger with some robustness analysis; does the quality of the evaluation hold up if the design decisions are made differently, if less data are used to estimate the evaluation model, etc.? How does it hold up across datasets, and across different types of dialogue systems? As a methodological note, there are a lot of significance tests here and no mention of any attempt to correct for this (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR, etc.).
 
 As interesting as the ideas here are, I can't see the dialogue community rushing to adopt this approach to evaluation based on the findings in this paper. I do think that the ideas it presents should be hashed out in a public forum sooner rather than later, and therefore recommend it as one of a few papers to be presented at the workshop."

One reason is that the standard training procedures find poor local optima when applied to such data. We propose two techniques that alleviate this problem, significantly improving our ability to fit DLGMs to sparse, high-dimensional data.

TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering long-range dependencies existing in the sequence of historical local trends, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency. Furthermore, for predicting the local trend, a feature fusion layer is designed in TreNet to learn joint representation from the features captured by CNN and LSTM.

While they benefit from multiple layers that encode nonlinear decision boundaries and a degree of translation invariance, training convnets is a lengthy procedure fraught with local optima. Alternatively, a kernel method that incorporates the compositionality and symmetry of convnets could learn similar nonlinear concepts yet with easier training and architecture selection. We propose compositional kernel machines (CKMs), which effectively create an exponential number of virtual training instances by composing transformed sub-regions of the original ones. Despite this, CKM discriminant functions can be computed efficiently using ideas from sum-product networks. The ability to compose virtual instances in this way gives CKMs invariance to translations and other symmetries, and combats the curse of dimensionality. Just as support vector machines (SVMs) provided a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons when they were introduced, CKMs could become an attractive approach for object recognition and other vision problems. In this paper we define CKMs, explore their properties, and present promising results on NORB datasets. Experiments show that CKMs can outperform SVMs and be competitive with convnets in a number of dimensions, by learning symmetries and compositional concepts from fewer samples without data augmentation.","['Computer vision', 'Supervised Learning']","There is consensus among the reviewers that the proposed method has potential merit, but that the experimental evaluation is too preliminary to warrant publication of the current manuscript.

Deep learning architectures are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, but previous work has focused on the application of adversarial examples to classification tasks. Deep generative models have recently become popular due to their ability to model input data distributions and generate realistic examples from those distributions. We present three classes of attacks on the VAE and VAE-GAN architectures and demonstrate them against networks trained on MNIST, SVHN and CelebA. Our first attack leverages classification-based adversaries by attaching a classifier to the trained encoder of the target generative model, which can then be used to indirectly manipulate the latent representation. Our second attack directly uses the VAE loss function to generate a target reconstruction image from the adversarial example. Our third attack moves beyond relying on classification or the standard loss for the gradient and directly optimizes against differences in source and target latent representations. We also motivate why an attacker might be interested in deploying such techniques against a target generative network.","['Computer vision', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The main idea in this paper is interesting, of considering various forms of adversarial examples in generative models.

At a high level, HCN is similar to a sigmoid belief network with pooling. Inference and learning in HCN are very challenging and existing variational approximations do not work satisfactorily. A main contribution of this work is to show that both can be addressed using max-product message passing (MPMP) with a particular schedule (no EM required). Also, using MPMP as an inference engine for HCN makes new tasks simple: adding supervision information, classifying images, or performing inpainting all correspond to clamping some variables of the model to their known values and running MPMP on the rest. When used for classification, fast inference with HCN has exactly the same functional form as a convolutional neural network (CNN) with linear activations and binary weights. However, HCN’s features are qualitatively very different.",['Unsupervised Learning'], The reviewer's opinions were clear for this paper.

277,Bkul3t9ee,Invite to Workshop Track,Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning,"Reward function design and exploration time are arguably the biggest obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world. In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function takes considerable manual engineering and often requires additional and potentially visible sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple steps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not necessarily provide useful feedback on these implicit intermediate steps or sub-goals.
To address these issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify the key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit sub-goal supervision. The resulting reward functions, which are dense and smooth, can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward functions, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to learn a complex real-world door opening skill using a real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.

SSPNs combine the expressivity and depth of SPNs with the ability to efficiently compute the MAP state of a combinatorial number of labelings afforded by submodular energies. SSPNs for scene understanding can be understood as representing all possible parses of an image over arbitrary region shapes with respect to an image grammar. Despite this complexity, we develop an efficient and convergent algorithm based on graph cuts for computing the (approximate) MAP state of an SSPN, greatly increasing the expressivity of the SPN model class.

The method is based on a gated neural network architecture, trained with an extension of the learning with robotic priors objective. In simulated experiments, we show that our method is able to learn better state representations for reinforcement learning, and we analyze why and when it manages to do so.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The authors propose to explore an important problem -- learning state representations for reinforcement learning. However, the experimental evaluation raised a number of concerns among the reviewers. The method is tested on only a single relatively easy domain, with some arbitrarily choices justified in unconvincing ways (e.g. computational limitations as a reason to not fix aliasing). The evaluation also compares to extremely weak baselines. In the end, there is insufficient evidence to convincingly show that the method actually works, and since the contribution is entirely empirical (as noted by the reviewers in regard to some arbitrary parameter choices), the unconvincing evaluation makes this method unsuitable for publication at this time. The authors would be encouraged to evaluate the method rigorously on a wide range of realistic tasks."

The model comprises a pair of complementary stochastic recurrent neural networks: the generative network models the joint distribution of the stochastic volatility process; the inference network approximates the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observable ones.
Our focus in this paper is on the formulation of temporal dynamics of volatility over time under a stochastic recurrent neural network framework. Our derivations show that some popular volatility models are a special case of our proposed neural stochastic volatility model. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model generates a smoother volatility estimation, and largely outperforms a widely used GARCH model on several metrics about the fitness of the volatility modelling and the accuracy of the prediction.","['Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","This paper presents an interesting application of variational methods for time series, in particular VRNN-like approaches, for stochastic volatility. Applications such as these are clearly in the scope of the conference, which was a point that one of the reviewer brought up. That said, questions of context, especially with regards to relation to different approaches, especially smoothing are relevant. Also, the number of methods GRACH and stochastic volatility is immense and this makes assessing the impact of this very hard to do and is more is needed to address this point. This paper is certainly interesting, but given these concerns, the paper is not yet rady for acceptance at the conference."

While these attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a computer program is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive research was carriedout in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous algorithms were introduced, aiming to learn how to perform human tasks such as playing video games. As a result, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Bellemare et al., 2013) has become a commonly used benchmark environment allowing algorithms to train on various Atari 2600 games. In many games the state-of-the-art algorithms outperform humans. In this paper we introduce a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment — RLE, that can run games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis and several other gaming consoles. The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch. SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to their higher level of complexity and versatility.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Deep learning', 'Games']","The authors present a new set of environments, similar to ALE but based on Super Nintendo rather than Atari. This is a great asset and could be important for RL research, but it doesn't merit ICLR publication because of the lack of novel research ideas. Hopefully the authors will consider another venue to publish this paper, such as perhaps a journal or workshop."

extend the scattering network to allow the use of higher order nonlinearities as
well as extracting nonlinear and Fourier based statistics leading to the required in-
variants of any inherently structured input. In order to reach fast convolutions and
to leverage the intrinsic structure of wavelets, we derive our complete model in the
Fourier domain. In addition of providing fast computations, we are now able to
exploit sparse matrices due to extremely high sparsity well localized in the Fourier
domain. As a result, we are able to reach a true linear time complexity with in-
puts in the Fourier domain allowing fast and energy efficient solutions to machine
learning tasks. Validation of the features and computational results will be pre-
sented through the use of these invariant coefficients to perform classification on
audio recordings of bird songs captured in multiple different soundscapes. In the
end, the applicability of the presented solutions to deep artificial neural networks
is discussed.","['Unsupervised Learning', 'Applications', 'Deep learning']","This paper proposes a to use squared modulus nonlinearities within convolutional architectures. Because point-wise squaring can be written as a convolution in the Fourier domain, when doing all the operations in the Fourier this architecture becomes 'dual': convolutions become pointwise operations, and pointwise square-nonlinearities become convolutions. 
 The authors study this architecture in the context of scattering transforms and produce a complexity analysis that exploits the previous property, along with preliminary numerical experiments.

In the simplest case, if one has access to pairs of the form (x, y) where y = g(x), the problem can be framed as a regression problem. Beyond this family of problems, we find many cases where the unavailability of data pairs makes this approach unfeasible. However, similar to what we find in the reinforcement learning literature, if we have some known properties of the function we are seeking to approximate, there is still hope to frame the problem as a regression problem. In this context, we present an algorithm that approximates the solution to a partial differential equation known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs PDE and compare it to current state of the art tools. This PDE, which is found in the fields of control theory and robotics, is of particular importance in safety critical systems where guarantees of performance are a must.","['Supervised Learning', 'Games', 'Theory']","The basic approach of this paper is to use a neural net to sequentially generate points that can be used as the basis points in a PDE solver. The idea is definitely an interesting one, and all three reviewers are in agreement that the approach does seem to have a lot of potential.
 
 The main drawback of the paper, simply, is that it's unclear whether this result would be of sufficient interest for the ICLR audience. Ultimately, it seems as though the authors are simply training a neural network to generate this points, and the interesting contribution here comes from the application to PDE solving, not really from any advance in the NN/ML side itself. As such, it seems like the paper would be better appreciated (as a full conference paper or journal paper), within the control community, rather than ICLR. However, I do think that as an application, many at ICLR would be interested in seeing this work, even if its likely to have relatively low impact on the community. Thus, I think the best avenue for this paper is probably as a workshop post at ICLR, hopefully with further submission and exposure in the controls community.

We show that a heuristic called minimum information constraint that has been shown to mitigate this effect in VAEs can also be applied to improve unsupervised clustering performance with our model. Furthermore we analyse the effect of this heuristic and provide an intuition of the various processes with the help of visualizations.

achieved on a typical classification task, by showing that for several network architectures

However, in these DML studies, there were no equitable comparisons between features extracted from a DML-based network and those from a softmax-based network.
In this paper, by presenting objective comparisons between these two approaches under the same network architecture, we show that the softmax-based features are markedly better than the state-of-the-art DML features for tasks such as fine-grained recognition, attribute estimation, clustering, and retrieval.","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning']","The paper aims to compare the representations learnt by metric learning and classification objectives.

We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags and friends on a dataset of Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques.","['Unsupervised Learning', 'Deep learning', 'Multi-modal learning']","This is largely a clearly written paper that proposes a nonlinear generalization of a generalized CCA approach for multi-view learning.

In this paper, we focus on this answer extraction task, presenting a novel model architecture that efficiently builds fixed length representations of all spans in the evidence document with a recurrent network.

- Data insufficiency: Often in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. 
- Interpretation: The representations learned by deep learning models should align with medical knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. 
Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. 
We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task.
Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.","['Deep learning', 'Applications']","The reviewers all agreed that the paper was well written, that the proposed approach is very sensible and intuitive and that the experiments are convincing.

Generative autoencoders are those which are trained to softly enforce a prior on the latent distribution learned by the inference model. We call the distribution to which the inference model maps observed samples, the learned latent distribution, which may not be consistent with the prior. We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively decoding and encoding, which allows us to sample from the learned latent distribution. Since, the generative model learns to map from the learned latent distribution, rather than the prior, we may use MCMC to improve the quality of samples drawn from the generative model, especially when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior. Using MCMC sampling, we are able to reveal previously unseen differences between generative autoencoders trained either with or without a denoising criterion.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Theory']","This approach taken in this paper is topical, especially since the importance of sampling and generating diverse samples is increasingly discussed in work on generative models.

These have been addressed to some extent by the authors, discussing in more detail the related work, especially in connection to Rezende et al., and GSN of Bengio et al., and with improved figures.

Variational approaches to training such models introduce a probabilistic encoder that casts data, typically unsupervised, into an entangled and unstructured representation space. While unsupervised learning is often desirable, sometimes even necessary, when we lack prior knowledge about what to represent, being able to incorporate domain knowledge in characterising certain aspects of variation in the data can often help learn better disentangled representations. Here, we introduce a new formulation of semi-supervised learning in variational autoencoders that allows precisely this. It permits flexible specification of probabilistic encoders as directed graphical models via a stochastic computation graph, containing both continuous and discrete latent variables, with conditional distributions parametrised by neural networks. We demonstrate how the provision of structure, along with a few labelled examples indicating plausible values for some components of the latent space, can help quickly learn disentangled representations. We then evaluate its ability to do so, both qualitatively by exploring its generative capacity, and quantitatively by using the disentangled representation to perform classification, on a variety of models and datasets.","['Semi-Supervised Learning', 'Deep learning', 'Computer vision']","The paper is a clearly presented application of deep generative models in the semi-supervised setting.

This stems from a long standing question. Given that deep networks are highly nonlinear systems optimized by local gradient methods, why do they not seem to be affected by bad local minima? It is widely believed that training of deep models using gradient methods works so well because the error surface either has no local minima, or if they exist they need to be close in value to the global minimum. It is known that such results hold under strong assumptions which are not satisfied by real models. In this paper we present examples showing that for such theorem to be true additional assumptions on the data, initialization schemes and/or the model classes have to be made. We look at the particular case of finite size datasets. We demonstrate that in this scenario one can construct counter-examples (datasets or initialization schemes) when the network does become susceptible to bad local minima over the weight space.","['Theory', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning', 'Optimization']","This paper analyzes under which circumstances bad local optima prevent effective training of deep neural networks.

To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios. In some cases, they even improve over the original accuracy, with relative increases up to 12%. We evaluate Bloom embeddings on 7 data sets and compare it against 4 alternative methods, obtaining favorable results. We also discuss a number of further advantages of Bloom embeddings, such as 'on-the-fly' constant-time operation, zero or marginal space requirements, training time speedups, or the fact that they do not require any change to the core model architecture or training configuration.","['Applications', 'Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The authors present a simple scheme based on Bloom filters to generate embeddings for inputs and outputs.

We study a Bayesian non-parametric sequential models based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The model is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals.

Thus, we can refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data. We propose efficient ways to solve this by augmenting deep Q-learning with a cross-entropy reward and deriving novel off-policy methods for RNNs from KL control. We explore the usefulness of our approach in the context of music generation. An LSTM is trained on a large corpus of songs to predict the next note in a musical sequence. This Note RNN is then refined using our method and rules of music theory.

We propose to examine interior gradients, which are gradients of counterfactual inputs constructed by scaling down the original input. We apply our method to the GoogleNet architecture for object recognition in images, as well as a ligand-based virtual screening network with categorical features and an LSTM based language model for the Penn Treebank dataset.

Moreover, when converted into Max-Product Networks (MPNs), it is possible to decode such representations back into the original input space. In this way, MPNs can be interpreted as a kind of generative autoencoder, even if they were never trained to reconstruct the input data. We show how these learned representations, if visualized, indeed correspond to ""meaningful parts"" of the training data. They also yield a large improvement when used in structured prediction tasks.

 The choice of baseline comparisons and benchmarks did not seem appropriate given the presented model and text. Specifically, it is difficult to determine how good of a generative model it is if the authors don't compare it to other generative models in terms of data likelihood under the model. Similarly, it's difficult to place it in the literature as a model for representation learning if it isn't compared to the state-of-the-art for RL on standard benchmarks.
 
 The clarifications of the authors and revisions to the manuscript are greatly appreciated. Hopefully this will help the authors to improve the manuscript and submit to another conference in the near future."

Many of the existing work in the area are task-specific and based on supervised techniques. We study a method for obtaining a generic feature representation for a graph using an unsupervised approach. The neural encoder-decoder model is a method that has been used in the natural language processing domain to learn feature representations of sentences. In our proposed approach, we train the encoder-decoder model to predict the random walk sequence of neighboring regions in a graph given a random walk along a particular region. The goal is to map subgraphs — as represented by their random walks — that are structurally and functionally similar to nearby locations in feature space. We evaluate the learned graph vectors using several real-world datasets on the graph classification task. The proposed model is able to achieve good results against state-of- the-art techniques.","['Unsupervised Learning', 'Deep learning']","The idea of applying skip-graphs to this graph domain to learn embeddings is good. The results demonstrate that this approach is competitive, but do not show a clear advantage. This is difficult, as the variety of approaches in this area is rapidly increasing. But comparisons to other methods could be improved, notably deep graph kernels."
308,BJa0ECFxe,Reject,Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise,"We introduce Information Dropout, a generalization of dropout that is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and highlights the way in which injecting noise in the activations can help in learning optimal representations of the data. Information Dropout is rooted in information theoretic principles, it includes as special cases several existing dropout methods, like Gaussian Dropout and Variational Dropout, and, unlike classical dropout, it can learn and build representations that are invariant to nuisances of the data, like occlusions and clutter. When the task is the reconstruction of the input, we show that the information dropout method yields a variational autoencoder as a special case, thus providing a link between representation learning, information theory and variational inference. Our experiments validate the theoretical intuitions behind our method, and we find that information dropout achieves a comparable or better generalization performance than binary dropout, especially on smaller models, since it can automatically adapt the noise to the structure of the network, as well as to the test sample.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","The authors all agree that the theory presented in the paper is of high quality and is promising but the experiments are not compelling. The reviewers are concerned that the presented idea and connections to existing methods, while neat, may not be impactful as the promise of the theory does not bear out in practice. One reviewer is concerned that the presented theory is still not useful, stating that the ""information bottleneck thus only becomes meaningful when the capacity of the encoding network is controlled in some measurable way, which is not discussed in the paper"". In general, they seem to agree that the experimental evaluation is still preliminary and unfinished. As such, it would seem that the authors could make the paper far more compelling by demonstrating more compelling improvements on benchmark experiments and submitting to a future conference."

best performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited
for supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts
have been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying
unsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and training methods.
In this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised training
of Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial regions

Rather than summing up expert votes as in products of experts, we employ for each variable the opinion of the most reliable expert. Data points are hence explained through a partitioning of the variables into expert supports. The partitions are dynamically adapted based on which experts are active. During the learning phase we adopt a smoothed version of this model that uses separate mixtures for each data dimension. In our experiments we achieve accurate reconstructions of high-dimensional data points with at most a dozen experts.",[],"This paper is about learning distributed representations.

DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer.

312,SyOvg6jxx,Reject,#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces, since most states will only occur once.
Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. 

In this work, we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash code may further improve these results.

Detailed analysis reveals important aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2) encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and Atari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require considerable exploration.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Games']","The paper proposes a simple approach to exploration that uses a hash of the current state within a exploration bonus approach (there are some modifications to learned hash codes, but this is the basic approach). The method achieves reasonable performance on Atari game tasks (sometimes outperformed by other approaches, but overall performing well), and it's simplicity is its main appeal (although the autoencoder-based learned hash seems substantially less simple, so actually loses some advantage there). 
 
 The paper is likely borderline, as the results are not fantastic: the approach is typically outperformed or similarly-performed by one of the comparison approaches (though it should be noted that no comparison approach performs well over all tasks, so this is not necessarily that bad). But overall, especially because so many of these methods have tunable hyperparameters it was difficult to get a clear understanding of just how these experimental results fit.
 
 Pros:
 + Simple method for exploration that seems to work reasonably well in practice
 + Would have the potential to be widely used because of its simplicity
 
 Cons:
 - Improvements over previous approaches are not always there, and it's not clear whether the algorithm has any ""killer app"" domain where it is just clearly the best approach
  
 Overall, this work in its current form is too borderline. The PCs encourage the authors to strengthen the empirical validation and resubmit."
313,HJV1zP5xg,Reject,Diverse Beam Search: Decoding Diverse Solutions from Neural Sequence Models,"Neural sequence models are widely used to model time-series data. Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores the search space in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top B candidates. This tends to result in sequences that differ only slightly from each other. Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing a diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method not only improved diversity but also finds better top 1 solutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search space. Moreover, these gains are achieved with minimal computational or memory overhead com- pared to beam search. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we present results on image captioning, machine translation, conversation and visual question generation using both standard quantitative metrics and qualitative human studies. We find that our method consistently outperforms BS and previously proposed techniques for diverse decoding from neural sequence models.","['Deep learning', 'Computer vision', 'Natural language processing']","Unfortunately, even after the reviewers adjusted their scores, this paper remains very close to the decision boundary. It presents a thorough empirical evaluation, but the improvements are fairly models. The area chair is also not convinced the idea itself will be very influential and change the way people do decoding since it feels a bit ad hoc (as pointed out by reviewer 1). Overall, this paper did not meet the bar for acceptance at ICLR this year."
314,ryUPiRvge,Invite to Workshop Track,Extrapolation and learning equations,"In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a
suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and  outputs.
In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and  generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.
","['Supervised Learning', 'Deep learning', 'Structured prediction']","This paper proposes using functions such as sin and cos as basis functions, then training a neural network with L1 regularization to obtain a simple estimate of functions that can extrapolate under some circumstances.
 
 Pros:
 - the paper has a wide-ranging discussion connecting extrapolation in regression problems to adjacent fields of system identification and causal learning.
 - the method is sensible enough, and should probably be a baseline in the time-series literature. It also seems like an advance on the hard-to-optimize Eureqa method.
 
 Cons:
 I agree with the authors that Reviewer 5's comments aren't very helpful, but this paper really does ignore or dismiss a lot of recent progress and related methods. Specifically:
 - The authors claim that cross-validation can't be used to choose the model, since it wouldn't encourage extrapolation - but why not partition the data in contiguous chunks, as is done in time-series methods?
 - The authors introduce an annealing trick to help with the L1 objective, but there is a rich literature on gradient-based optimization methods with L1 regularization that address exactly this problem.
 - The authors mostly consider toy data, limiting the potential impact of their method.
 - The authors don't compare against closely related methods developed to address the exact same setting. Namely, Schmit + Lipson's Eureqa method, and the Gaussian process methods of Duvenaud, Lloyd, Grosse, Tenenbaum and Ghahramani.
 - The authors invent their own ad-hoc model-selection procedure, again ignoring a massive literature.
 
 Given the many ""cons"", it is recommended that this paper not be presented at the conference track, but be featured at the workshop track."
315,r1kQkVFgl,Reject,Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,"To enhance developer productivity, all modern integrated development environments (IDEs) include code suggestion functionality that proposes likely next tokens at the cursor. While current IDEs work well for statically-typed languages, their reliance on type annotations means that they do not provide the same level of support for dynamic programming languages as for statically-typed languages. Moreover, suggestion engines in modern IDEs do not propose expressions or multi-statement idiomatic code. Recent work has shown that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long range dependencies. We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past.",[],"This paper augments language models with attention to to capture long range dependencies through a sparse pointer network that is restricted to previously introduced identifiers, and demonstrates the proposed architecture over a new, released large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code. The addition of long range attention over 20 identifiers improves perplexity compared to an LSTM with an attentional context of 50 words, but degrades accuracy (hit @1), while improving hit@5.
 The experimental validation however requires a more thorough analysis and more detailed ablation experiments and discussions, and more thorough comparison to related work. As is, many choices seem quite arbitrary and make it hard to determine if the model is really performing well (minibatch sizes, size of the memory for the LSTM, choice and number of identifiers for the sparse pointers, etc)."
316,ByToKu9ll,Reject,Evaluation of Defensive Methods for DNNs against Multiple Adversarial Evasion Models,"Due to deep cascades of nonlinear units, deep neural networks (DNNs) can automatically learn non-local generalization priors from data and have achieved high performance in various applications.
However, such properties have also opened a door for adversaries to generate the so-called adversarial examples to fool DNNs. Specifically, adversaries can inject small perturbations to the input data and therefore decrease the performance of deep neural networks significantly.
Even worse, these adversarial examples have the transferability to attack a black-box model based on finite queries without knowledge of the target model. 
Therefore, we aim to empirically compare different defensive strategies against various adversary models and analyze the cross-model efficiency for these robust learners. We conclude that the adversarial retraining framework also has the transferability, which can defend adversarial examples without requiring prior knowledge of the adversary models.
We compare the general adversarial retraining framework with the state-of-the-art robust deep neural networks, such as distillation, autoencoder stacked with classifier (AEC), and our improved version, IAEC, to evaluate their robustness as well as the vulnerability in terms of the distortion required to mislead the learner.
Our experimental results show that the adversarial retraining framework can defend most of the adversarial examples notably and consistently without adding additional
vulnerabilities or performance penalty to the original model.",['Deep learning'],"The paper investigates several retraining approached based upon adversarial data. While the experimental evaluation looks reasonable, the actual contribution of this paper is quite small. The approaches being evaluated, for the most part, are already proposed in the literature, with the one exception being the ""improved autoencoder stacked with classifier"" (IAEC), which is really just a minor modification to the existing AEC approach with an additional regularization term. The results are fairly thorough, and seem to suggest that the IAEC method performs best in some cases, but this is definitely not a novel enough contribution to warrant publication at ICLR.
 
 Pros:
 + Nice empirical evaluation of several adversarial retraining methods
 
 Cons:
 - Extremely minor algorithmic advances
 - Not clear what is the significant contribution of the paper"
317,HyenWc5gx,Reject,Representation Stability as a Regularizer for Improved Text Analytics Transfer Learning,"Although neural networks are well suited for sequential transfer learning tasks, the catastrophic forgetting problem hinders proper integration of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a multi-task objective based on the idea of distillation and a mechanism that directly penalizes forgetting at the shared representation layer during the knowledge integration phase of training. We demonstrate our approach on a Twitter domain sentiment analysis task with sequential knowledge transfer from four related tasks.  We show that our technique outperforms networks fine-tuned to the target task. Additionally, we show both through empirical evidence and examples that it does not forget useful knowledge from the source task that is forgotten during standard fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that first distilling a human made rule based sentiment engine into a recurrent neural network and then integrating the knowledge with the target task data leads to a substantial gain in generalization performance. Our experiments demonstrate the power of multi-source transfer techniques in practical text analytics problems when paired with distillation. In particular, for the SemEval 2016 Task 4 Subtask A (Nakov et al., 2016) dataset we surpass the state of the art established during the competition with a comparatively simple model architecture that is not even competitive when trained on only the labeled task specific data.","['Deep learning', 'Transfer Learning', 'Natural language processing']","The proposed approach is not consistently applied for the different experiments; this significantly harms the overall value of the research.

Despite recent advances, our understanding of these learning models is still incomplete, at least, as their unexpected vulnerability to imperceptibly small, non-random perturbations revealed. The existence of these so-called adversarial examples presents a serious problem of the application of vulnerable machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce the layerwise origin-target synthesis (LOTS) that can serve multiple purposes. First, we can use it as a visualization technique that gives us insights into the function of any intermediate feature layer by showing the notion of a particular input in deep neural networks. Second, our approach can be applied to assess the invariance of the learned features captured at any layer with respect to the class of the particular input. Finally, we can also utilize LOTS as a general way of producing a vast amount of diverse adversarial examples that can be used for training to further improve the robustness of machine learning models and their performance as well.","['Deep learning', 'Computer vision']","This paper studies the effects of modifying intermediate representations arising in deep convolutional networks, with the purpose of visualizing the role of specific neurons, and also to construct adversarial examples.

 The reviewers agreed that, while this contribution presents an interesting framework, it lacks comparisons with existing methods, and the description of the method lacks sufficient rigor. In light of the discussions and the current state of the submission, the AC recommends rejection. 
 
 Since the final scores of the reviewers might suggest otherwise, please let me explain my recommendation. 
 
 The main contribution of this paper seems to be essentially a fast alternative to the method proposed in 'Adversarial Manipulation of Deep Representations', by Sabour et al, ICLR'16, although the lack of rigor and clarity in the presentation of section 3 makes this assessment uncertain. The most likely 'interpretation' of Eq (3) suggests that eta(x_o, x_t) = nabla_{x_o}( || f^(l)_w(x_t) - f^(l)_w(x_o) ||^2), which is simply one step of gradient descent of the method described in Sabour et al. One reviewer actually asked for clarification on this point on Dec. 26th, but the problem seems to be still present in the current manuscript. 
 
 More generally, visualization and adversarial methods based on backpropagation of some form of distance measured in feature space towards the pixel space are not new; they can be traced back to Simoncelli & Portilla '99. 
 Fast approximations based on simply stopping the gradient descent after one iteration do not constitute enough novelty. 
 
 Another instance of lack of clarity that has also been pointed out in this discussion but apparently not addressed in the final version is the so-called PASS measure. It is not defined anywhere in the text, and the authors should not expect the reader to know its definition beforehand. 
 
 Besides these issues, the paper does not contribute to the state-of-the-art of adversarial training nor feature visualization, mostly because its experiments are limited to mnist and face datasets. Since the main contribution of the paper is empirical, more emphasis should be made to present experiments on larger, more numerous datasets."

Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood,  RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units -- called leaky RBM.  We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions.  The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.  This serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS).  We further demonstrate that the proposed sampling algorithm enjoys faster mixing property than contrastive divergence algorithm, which benefits the training without any additional computational cost.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","This paper identifies a joint distribution for an RBM variant based on leaky-ReLU activations. It also proposes using a sequence of distributions, both as an annealing-based training method, or to estimate log(Z) with AIS.
 
 This paper was borderline. While there is an interesting idea, the reviewers weren't generally as excited by the work as for other papers. One limitation is that unit-variance Gaussian RBMs aren't a strong baseline for comparison, although that is the focus of the main body of the paper.

321,ByEPMj5el,Reject,Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation,"Recent advances in machine learning have brought the field closer to computational creativity research. From a creativity research point of view, this offers the potential to study creativity in relationship with knowledge acquisition. From a machine learning perspective, however, several aspects of creativity need to be better defined to allow the machine learning community to develop and test hypotheses in a systematic way. We propose an actionable definition of creativity as the generation of out-of-distribution novelty. We assess several  metrics designed for evaluating the quality of generative models on this new task. We also propose a new experimental setup. Inspired by the usual held-out validation, we hold out entire classes for evaluating the generative potential of models. The goal of the novelty generator is then to use training classes to build a model that can generate objects from future (hold-out) classes, unknown at training time - and thus, are novel with respect to the knowledge the model incorporates. Through extensive experiments on various types of generative models, we are able to find architectures and hyperparameter combinations which lead to out-of-distribution novelty.

 A large section of the paper is devoted to review, and more detail could be given to the experimental framework. It is not clear whether the framework can actually be useful outside the synthetic setup described. Moreover, I worry it encourages unhealthy directions for the field. Over 1000 models were trained and evaluated. There is no form of separate held-out comparison: the framework encourages people to keep trying random stuff until the chosen measure reports success."

To find the right balance between these, we propose to use problem-specific information encoded in algorithms together with the ability to learn details about the problem-instance from data. We demonstrate this approach in the context of state estimation in robotics, where we propose end-to-end learnable histogram filters---a differentiable implementation of histogram filters that encodes the structure of recursive state estimation using prediction and measurement update but allows the specific models to be learned end-to-end, i.e. in such a way that they optimize the performance of the filter, using either supervised or unsupervised learning.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","In many respects, this is a strong paper, in my opinion better than the reviews thus far in the system suggest. The idea of learning the parameters of a state estimation system, even if it is a simple example like a histogram filter, is an interesting idea from both the ML and robotics perspectives.
 
 However, I think it's also fairly clear (from the reviews if nothing else), that substantial additional work needs to be done if this paper is to convey these ideas clearly and impactfully to the ICLR community. The value of the histogram filter may be obvious to the robotics community (though even there it seems like it would be worth pursuing the extension of these ideas to the case e.g. of particle filters), as these have historically been an important conceptual milestone in robotic perception, but the examples shown in this paper are extremely simplistic. Given that histogram filters inherently scale poorly with dimension, it's not clear from this paper itself why the techniques show particular promise for scaling up to realistic domains in the future.
 
 Pros:
 + Interesting idea of using training a state estimator end-to-end for robotics tasks
 
 Cons:
 - Histogram filters, while well-motivated historically from the robotics standpoint, are really toy examples at this point except in a very small number of settings.
 - The results aren't all that compelling, showing modest improvement (over seemingly not-very-tuned alternatively approaches), on fairly simple domains."

However, classifying short and noisy text remains challenging. Feature sparsity is a major issue. The quality of document representation here has a great impact on the classification accuracy. Existing methods represent text using bag-of-word model, with TFIDF or other weighting schemes. Recently word embedding and even document embedding are proposed to represent text. The purpose is to capture features at both word level and sentence level. However, the character level information are usually ignored. In this paper, we take word morphology and word semantic meaning into consideration, which are represented by character-aware embedding and word distributed embedding. By concatenating both character-level and word distributed embedding together and arranging words in order, a sentence representation matrix could be obtained. To overcome data sparsity problem of short text, sentence representation vector is then derived based on different views from sentence representation matrix. The various views contributes to the construction of an enriched sentence embedding. We employ a residual network on the sentence embedding to get a consistent and refined sentence representation.

Finally, the benchmarks presented against are weak. There are several character-aware language models which obtain robust results on LM data which could readily be adapted to sentence representation learning, eg.

ReasoNet makes use of multiple turns to effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents, and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNet introduces a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNet can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer.

However, due to the size of knowledge bases, learning multi-step relations directly on top of observed instances could be costly. In this paper, we propose Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs), which is designed to perform large-scale inference implicitly through a search controller and shared memory. Unlike previous work, IRNs use training data to learn to perform multi-step inference through the shared memory, which is also jointly updated during training. While the inference procedure is not operating on top of observed instances for IRNs, our proposed model outperforms all previous approaches on the popular FB15k benchmark by more than 5.7%.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","This paper develops a new shared memory based model for doing inference in knowledge bases.

Despite the author promising to add additional experiments, nothing was added in the current draft. Besides this, reviewers raised concerns about the relevance of this approach to ICLR. The crucial point here is that it's unclear if the method will scale -- while there is nothing wrong in principle in proposing a general policy search method, there isn't really a compelling argument that can be made that it is suitable for learning representations if there is no plausible story for how it will scale to sufficiently complex policy classes that can actually learn representations."

We use scattering as a generic and fixed initialization of the first layers of a deep network, and learn the remaining layers in a supervised manner. We numerically demonstrate that deep hybrid scattering networks generalize better on small datasets than supervised deep networks. Scattering networks could help current systems to save computation time, while guaranteeing the stability  to geometric transformations and noise of the first internal layers. We also show that the learned operators explicitly build invariances to geometrical variabilities, such as local rotation and translation, by analyzing the third layer of our architecture.  We demonstrate that it is possible to replace the scattering transform by a standard deep network at the cost of having to learn more parameters and potentially adding instabilities. Finally, we release a new software, ScatWave, using GPUs for fast computations of a scattering network that is integrated in Torch. We evaluate our model on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and STL10 datasets.","['Computer vision', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Deep learning']","The program committee appreciates the authors' response to concerns raised in the reviews.

Our results are evaluated on a gait cycle imitation task for multiple planar articulated figures and multiple gaits. We demonstrate that the local feedback provided by higher-level action parameterizations can significantly impact the learning, robustness, and quality of the resulting policies.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Applications']","After reading the paper and the reviews, I believe that the paper presents a solid contribution and a detailed empirical exploration of the choice of action space representations for continuous control trajectory tracking tasks, but has limited relevance to the ICLR audience in its present form.
 
 The conclusion that PD controllers with learned gains provide improved learning speed and sometimes better final results than the ""default"" joint torque representation is intriguing and has some implications for future work on trajectory tracking for simulated articulated rigid body characters, but it's unclear from the current results what conclusion there is to take away for general algorithm or model design. Since the only evaluation is on trajectory tracking, it's also not even clear (as pointed out by other reviewers) to what degree these results will generalize to other tasks. In fact, a contrarian view might be that PD tracking is specifically a good fit for trajectory tracking with a known reference trajectory, but might be a poor fit for accomplishing a particular task, where more open-loop behaviors might be more optimal. The passive compliance of MTUs is also shown to often not be beneficial, but it's again not clear whether this might in fact be an artifact of the trajectory tracking task.
 
 But perhaps more problematically, the primary conclusions of the paper are of limited relevance when it comes to design of algorithms or models (or at least, the authors don't discuss this), but are more relevant for practitioners interested in applying deep RL for learning controllers for articulated rigid body systems such as robots or virtual characters. As such, it's not clear what fraction of the ICLR audience will find the paper relevant to their interests.

330,HJOZBvcel,Invite to Workshop Track,Learning to Discover Sparse Graphical Models,"We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical methods. ",[],"The authors provide a modern twist to the classical problem of graphical model selection. Traditionally, the sparsity priors to encourage selection of specific structures is hand-engineered. Instead, the authors propose using a neural network to train for these priors. Since graphical models are useful in the small-sample regime, using neural networks directly on the training data is not effective. Instead, the authors propose generating data based on the desired graph structures to train the neural network.

To address this problem, we develop a new technique for collective operations, referred to as Linear Pipelining (LP). It is tuned to the message sizes that arise in BSP-SGD, and works effectively on multi-GPU systems. Theoretically, the cost of LP is invariant to P , where P is the number of GPUs, while the cost of more conventional Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) scales like O(log P ). LP also demonstrate up to 2x faster bandwidth than Bidirectional Exchange (BE) techniques that are widely adopted by current MPI implementations. We apply these collectives to BSP-SGD, showing that the proposed implementations reduce communication bottlenecks in practice while preserving the attractive convergence properties of BSP-SGD.","['Applications', 'Deep learning']","The authors propose improvements for the utilization of modern hardware when training using stochastic gradient.

Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation for supervised tasks can be attained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations between the input, latent, and output variables. From this base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables semantic perturbation on the latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled additive noise while preserving its original semantics. It implicitly brings the effect of semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical analyses for the proposed latent space modeling method including t-SNE visualization.","['Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","The reviewers all expressed concerns with the technical quality of this work.

Some of the reviewers also had concerns with the choice of experiments, expressing that the authors did not choose the right baseline comparisons to compare to (e.g. convolutional networks vs. fully connected networks on MNIST).

Our simplistic model that does not use any convolutions performs comparably to Deep Convolutional Siamese Networks on various visual tasks. However using ARCs and convolutional feature extractors in conjunction produces a model that is significantly better than any other method and has superior generalization capabilities.

Unfortunately, even in simple environments, the popular deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is doomed by a Sisyphean curse. Owing to the use of function approximation, these agents eventually forget experiences as they become exceedingly unlikely under a new policy. Consequently, for as long as they continue to train, DQNs may periodically relive catastrophic mistakes. Many real-world environments where people might be injured exhibit a special structure. We know a priori that catastrophes are not only bad, but that agents need not ever get near to a catastrophe state. In this paper, we exploit this structure to learn a reward-shaping that accelerates learning and guards oscillating policies against repeated catastrophes. First, we demonstrate unacceptable performance of DQNs on two toy problems. We then introduce intrinsic fear, a new method that mitigates these problems by avoiding dangerous states. Our approach incorporates a second model trained via supervised learning to predict the probability of catastrophe within a short number of steps. This score then acts to penalize the Q-learning objective, shaping the reward function away from catastrophic states.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Applications']","This paper presents a few interesting ideas, namely the idea of keeping around a set of ""danger states"" and treating these states with some special consideration in reply to make sure that their impact is not neglected after collecting a lot of additional data.

However, it is still a common annoyance during the training phase, that one has to prepare at least thousands of labeled images to fine-tune a network to a specific domain. Recent study shows that a DNN has strong dependency towards the training dataset, and the learned features cannot be easily transferred to a different but relevant task without fine-tuning.

It avoids the large vocabulary issue radically; at the same time, it is more efficient in training than word-based models.

To fill this gap, we propose Knowledge Adaptation, an extension of Knowledge Distillation (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) to the domain adaptation scenario. We show how a student model achieves state-of-the-art results on unsupervised domain adaptation from multiple sources on a standard sentiment analysis benchmark by taking into account the domain-specific expertise of multiple teachers and the similarities between their domains.

When learning from a single teacher, using domain similarity to gauge trustworthiness is inadequate.

346,B1TTpYKgx,Reject,On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks,"We study the expressive power of deep neural networks before and after
training. Considering neural nets after random initialization, we show that
three natural measures of expressivity all display an exponential dependence
on the depth of the network. We prove, theoretically and experimentally,
that all of these measures are in fact related to a fourth quantity, trajectory
length. This quantity grows exponentially in the depth of the network, and
is responsible for the depth sensitivity observed. These results translate
to consequences for networks during and after training. They suggest that
parameters earlier in a network have greater influence on its expressive power
– in particular, given a layer, its influence on expressivity is determined by
the remaining depth of the network after that layer. This is verified with
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also explore the effect of training
on the input-output map, and find that it trades off between the stability
and expressivity of the input-output map.","['Theory', 'Deep learning']","While the reviewers saw some value in your contribution, there were also serious issues, so the paper does not reach the acceptance threshold."

networks of the same depth and are trainable at extreme depths. It has
recently been shown that Residual Networks behave like ensembles of relatively
shallow networks. We show that these ensemble are dynamic: while initially
the virtual ensemble is mostly at depths lower than half the network’s depth, as
training progresses, it becomes deeper and deeper. The main mechanism that controls
the dynamic ensemble behavior is the scaling introduced, e.g., by the Batch
Normalization technique. We explain this behavior and demonstrate the driving
force behind it. As a main tool in our analysis, we employ generalized spin glass
models, which we also use in order to study the number of critical points in the
optimization of Residual Networks.","['Deep learning', 'Theory']","The paper presents an analysis of residual networks and argues that the residual networks behave as ensembles of shallow networks, whose depths are dynamic.

 However, I have to agree with reviewer 1 that the assumption of path independence is deeply flawed. In my opinion, it was also flawed in the original paper. Using that as a justification to continue this line of research is not the right approach. We cannot construct a single practical scenario where path independence may be expected to hold. So we should not be encouraging papers to continue this line of flawed reasoning.

To reduce this gap we propose to describe the activity of individual neurons by quantifiyng their inherent selectivity to specific properties. Our approach is based on the definition of feature selectivity indexes that allow the ranking of neurons according to specific properties. Here we report the results of exploring selectivity indexes for: (a) an image feature (color); and (b) an image label (class membership). Our contribution is a framework to seek or classify neurons by indexing on these selectivity properties. It helps to find color selective neurons, such as a red-mushroom neuron in layer conv4 or class selective neurons such as dog-face neurons in layer conv5, and establishes a methodology to derive other selectivity properties.  Indexing on neuron selectivity can statistically draw how features and classes are represented through layers at a moment when the size of trained nets is growing and automatic tools to index can be helpful.

It can be shown that optimizing for SGNS objective can be viewed as an optimization problem of searching for a good matrix with the low-rank constraint. The most standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices.

352,BkjLkSqxg,Reject,LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading,"Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word classification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have shown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton & Basala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context in an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to text, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, LipNet is the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading model that simultaneously learns spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence model. On the GRID corpus, LipNet achieves 95.2% accuracy in sentence-level, overlapped speaker split task, outperforming experienced human lipreaders and the previous 86.4% word-level state-of-the-art accuracy (Gergen et al., 2016).","['Computer vision', 'Deep learning']","Let me start by saying that your area chair does not read Twitter, Reddit/ML, etc. The metareview below is, therefore, based purely on the manuscript and the reviews and rebuttal on OpenReview.
 
 The goal of the ICLR review process is to establish a constructive discussion between the authors of a paper on one side and reviewers and the broader machine-learning community on the other side. The goal of this discussion is to help the authors leverage the community for improving their manuscript.
 
 Whilst one may argue that some of the initial reviews could have provided a more detailed motivation for their rating, there is no evidence that the reviewers were influenced (or even aware of) discussions about this paper on social or other media --- in fact, none of the reviews refers to claims made in those media. Suggestions by the authors that the reviewers are biased by (social) media are, therefore, unfounded: there can be many valid reasons for the differences in opinion between reviewers and authors on the novelty, originality, or importance of this work. The authors are free to debate the opinion of the reviewers, but referring to the reviews as ""absolute nonsense"", ""unreasonable"", ""condescending"", and ""disrespectful"" is not helping the constructive scientific discussion that ICLR envisions and, frankly, is very offensive to reviewers who voluntarily spend their time in order to improve the quality of scientific research in our field.
 
 Two area chairs have read the paper. They independently reached the conclusion that (1) the reviewers raise valid concerns with respect to the novelty and importance of this work and (2) that the paper is, indeed, borderline for ICLR. The paper is an application paper, in which the authors propose the firstÊend-to-end sentence level lip reading using deep learning. Positive aspects of the paper include:
 
 - A comprehensive and organized review about previous work.
 - Clear description of the model and experimental methods.
 - Careful reporting of the results, with attention to detail.
 - Proposed method appears to perform better than the prior state-of-the-art, and generalizes across speakers.
 
 However, the paper has several prominent negative aspects as well:
 
 - The GRID corpus that is used for experimentation has very substantial (known) limitations. In particular, it is constructed in a way that leads to a very limited (non-natural) set of sentences.Ê(For every word, there is an average of just 8.5 possible options the model has to choose from.)
 - The paper overstates some of its claims. In particular, the claim that the model is ""outperforming experienced human lipreaders"" is questionable: it is not unlikely that model achieves its performance by exploiting unrealistic statistical biases in the corpus that humans cannot / do not exploit. Similarly, the claims about the ""sentence-level"" nature of the model are not substantiated: it remains unclear what aspects of the model make this a sentence-level model, nor is there much empirical evidence that the sentence-level treatment of video data is helping much (the NoLM baseline is almost as good as LipNet, despite the strong biases in the GRID corpus).
 - The paper makes several other statements that are not well-founded. As one of the reviewers correctly remarks, the McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication (it merely shows that vision can influence speech recognition). Similarly, the claim that ""Bi-GRUs are crucial for efficient further aggregation"" is not supported by empirical evidence.
 
 A high-level downside of this paper is that, while studying a relevant application of deep learning, it presents no technical contributions or novel insights that have impact beyond the application studied in the paper."

Recent advances in evidence theory show that in an imbalance multiclass learning problem, optimizing of proper objective functions based on contingency tables prevents biases towards high-prior classes. Transfer learning usually deals with highly non-convex objectives and local minima in deep neural architectures. We propose a novel distributed transfer learning to tackle both optimization complexity and class-imbalance problem jointly. Our solution imposes separated greedy regularization to each individual convolutional filter to make single-filter neural networks such that the minority classes perform as the majority ones. Then, basic probability assignment from evidence theory boosts these distributed networks to improve the recognition performance on the target domains. Our experiments on several standard datasets confirm the consistent improvement as a result of our distributed transfer learning strategy.","['Deep learning', 'Transfer Learning', 'Supervised Learning', 'Optimization']","All three reviewers appeared to have substantial difficulties understanding the proposed approach due to unclear presentation.

Existing works solve this problem by reducing model size using weight approximation methods based on dimension reduction (i.e., SVD, Tucker decomposition and Quantization). However, the execution speed of these compressed models are still far below the real-time processing requirement of mobile services. To address this limitation, we propose a novel acceleration framework: DeepRebirth by exploring the deep learning model parameter sparsity through merging the parameter-free layers with their neighbor convolution layers to a single dense layer. The design of DeepRebirth is motivated by the key observation: some layers (i.e., normalization and pooling) in deep learning models actually consume a large portion of computational time even few learned parameters are involved, and acceleration of these layers has the potential to improve the processing speed significantly. Essentially, the functionality of several merged layers is replaced by the new dense layer – rebirth layer in DeepRebirth. In order to preserve the same functionality, the rebirth layer model parameters are re-trained to be functionality equivalent to the original several merged layers. The extensive experiments performed on ImageNet using several popular mobile devices demonstrate that DeepRebirth is not only providing huge speed-up in model deployment and significant memory saving but also maintaining the model accuracy, i.e., 3x-5x speed-up and energy saving on GoogLeNet with only 0.4% accuracy drop on top-5 categorization in ImageNet. Further, by combining with other model compression techniques, DeepRebirth offers an average of 65ms model forwarding time on each image using Samsung Galaxy S6 with only 2.4% accuracy drop.

The joint relational and temporal dynamics of the series are modeled as Gaussian distributions in a latent space. A decoder maps the latent representations to the observations. The two components (dynamic model and decoder) are jointly trained.

recurrent structure in RNNs, we provide the models with better short-term memory mechanism to learn long term dependency in sequences. Analogous to digital filters in signal processing, we call these structures as higher order RNNs (HORNNs). Similar to RNNs, HORNNs can also be learned using the back-propagation through time method. HORNNs are generally applicable to a variety of sequence modelling tasks. In this work, we have examined HORNNs for the language modeling task using two popular data sets, namely the Penn Treebank (PTB) and English text8.

General consensus in this field dictates that the argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on extracting links between argument components, with a secondary focus on classifying types of argument components. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a modification of a Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links between argument components.

370,ryAe2WBee,Reject,Multi-label learning with semantic embeddings,"Multi-label learning aims to automatically assign to an instance (e.g., an image or a document) the most relevant subset of labels from a large set of possible labels. The main challenge is to maintain accurate predictions while scaling efficiently on data sets with extremely large label sets and many training data points. We propose a simple but effective neural net approach, the Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), that models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features. A Gauss-Siedel mini-batch adaptive gradient descent algorithm is used to fit the model. To handle extremely large label sets, we propose and experimentally validate the efficacy of fitting randomly chosen marginal label distributions. Experimental results on eight real-world data sets show that SEM garners significant performance gains over existing methods. In particular, we compare SEM to four recent state-of-the-art algorithms (NNML, BMLPL, REmbed, and SLEEC) and find that SEM uniformly outperforms these algorithms in several widely used evaluation metrics while requiring significantly less training time.

A significant number of neural architectures for this task (neural readers) have recently been developed and evaluated on large cloze-style datasets. We present experiments supporting the emergence of “predication structure” in the hidden state vectors of a class of neural readers including the Attentive Reader and Stanford Reader. We posits that the hidden state vectors can be viewed as (a representation of) a concatenation [P, c] of a “predicate vector” P and a “constant symbol vector” c and that the hidden state represents the atomic formula P(c). This predication structure plays a conceptual role in relating “aggregation readers” such as the Attentive Reader and the Stanford Reader to “explicit reference readers” such as the Attention-Sum Reader, the Gated-Attention Reader and the Attention-over-Attention Reader.

It is observed that the models trained by SGD are sensitive to learning rates and good learning rates are problem specific. To avoid manually searching of learning rates, which is tedious and inefficient, we propose an algorithm to automatically learn learning rates using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we train a policy network called actor to decide the learning rate at each step during training, and a value network called critic to give feedback about quality of the decision (e.g., the goodness of the learning rate outputted by the actor) that the actor made. Experiments show that our method leads to good convergence of SGD and can prevent overfitting to a certain extent, resulting in better performance than human-designed competitors.","['Deep learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']","The authors use actor-critic reinforcement learning to adjust the step size of a supervised learning algorithm.

Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from multiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly than conventional VAEs. We further demonstrate that JMVAE can generate multiple modalities bi-directionally.

We find that CNNs learn invariance wrt all 9 tested transformation types and that invariance extends to transformations outside the training range.

If the preimage set of a certain activity in the network contains elements from more than one class it means that these classes are irreversibly mixed. This implies that preimage sets which are piecewise linear manifolds are building blocks for describing the input manifolds specific classes, i.e. all preimages should ideally be from the same class. We believe that the knowledge of how to compute preimages will be valuable in understanding the efficiency displayed by deep learning networks and could potentially be used in designing more efficient training algorithms.",[],"This paper studies the invertibility properties of deep rectified networks, and more generally the piecewise linear structure that they implicitly define.

 The reviewers agreed that, while this is an interesting and important question, the paper is currently poorly organized, and leaves the reader a bit disoriented, since the analysis is incomplete. The AC thus recommends rejection of the manuscript. 
 
 As an addendum, the AC thinks that the authors should make an effort to reorganize the paper and clearly state the contributions, and not expect the reader to find them out on their own. In this field of machine learning, I see contributions as being either (i) theoretical, in which case we expect to see theorems and proofs, (ii) algorithmical, in which case an algorithmic is presented, studied, extensively tested, and laid out in such a way that the interested reader can use it, or (iii) experimental, in which case we expect to see improved numerical performance in some dataset. Currently the paper has none of these contributions.

In this paper, we proposed a generalizable k-shot learning framework that can be used on any pre-trained network, by grouping network parameters to produce a low-dimensional representation of the parameter space. The grouping of the parameters is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the parameter space. To avoid overfitting, groups of parameters will be updated together during the k-shot training process. Furthermore, this framework can be integrated with any existing popular deep neural networks such as VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet, without any changes in the original network structure or any sacrifices in performance.

However, the increasing complexity of the problems, as well as the use of more sophisticated models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), impedes the understanding of artificial agents behavior. In this work, we present the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The purpose of the SAMDP modeling is to describe and allow a better understanding of complex behaviors by identifying temporal and spatial abstractions. In contrast to other modeling approaches, SAMDP is built in a transformed state-space that encodes the dynamics of the problem. We show that working with the \emph{right} state representation mitigates the problem of finding spatial and temporal abstractions. We describe the process of building the SAMDP model from observed trajectories and give examples for using it in a toy problem and complicated DQN policies. Finally, we show how using the SAMDP we can monitor the policy at hand and make it more robust.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Deep learning']","The paper combines semi-Markov models with state aggregation models to define a Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP).

However, training SFNN is notoriously harder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for large-scale SFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of DNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called Simplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNN and approximates certain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The main novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three models, i.e., DNN
-> Simplified-SFNN -> SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient training procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of DNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively transferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and classification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. In particular, our stochastic model built from the wide residual network has 28 layers and 36 million parameters, where the former consistently outperforms the latter for the classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 due to its stochastic regularizing effect.","['Deep learning', 'Multi-modal learning', 'Structured prediction']",No reviewer was willing to champion the paper and the authors did not adequately address reviewer comments in a revision.

But how could we confirm that the network understands these concepts or it just does not? (2) cross-modal supervision for visual representation learning draws much attention recently.

A typical room, for example, contains salient objects such as tables, chairs and books, and these objects typically relate to each other by virtue of their correlated features, such as position, function and shape. Humans exploit knowledge of objects and their relations for learning a wide spectrum of tasks, and more generally when learning the structure underlying observed data. In this work, we introduce relation networks (RNs) - a general purpose neural network architecture for object-relation reasoning. We show that RNs are capable of learning object relations from scene description data. Furthermore, we show that RNs can act as a bottleneck that induces the factorization of objects from entangled scene description inputs, and from distributed deep representations of scene images provided by a variational autoencoder. The model can also be used in conjunction with differentiable memory mechanisms for implicit relation discovery in one-shot learning tasks. Our results suggest that relation networks are a powerful architecture for solving a variety of problems that require object relation reasoning.",[],"This paper proposes RNs, relational networks, for representing and reasoning about object relations. Experiments show interesting results such as the capability to disentangling scene descriptions. AR3 praises the idea and the authors for doing this nice and involved analysis. AR1 also liked the paper. Indeed, taking a step back and seeing whether we are able to learn meaningful relations is needed in order to build more complex systems.
 
 However, AR2 raised some important issues: 1) the paper is extremely toy; RN has a very simplistic structure, and is only shown to work on synthetic examples that to some extent fit the assumptions of the RN. 2) there is important literature that addresses relation representations that has been entirely overlooked by the authors. The reviewer implied missed citations from a field that is all about learning object relations. In its current form, the paper does not have a review of related work. The AC does not see any citations in a discussion nor in the final revision. This is a major letdown. The reviewer also mentioned the fact that showing results on real datasets would strengthen the paper, which was also brought up by AR3.

One important aspect of this ability is physical intuition(Lake et al., 2016). In this work, we explore the potential of unsupervised learning to find features that promote better generalization to settings outside the supervised training distribution.  Our task is predicting the stability of towers of square blocks.

387,HkLXCE9lx,Reject,RL^2: Fast Reinforcement Learning via Slow Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL^2, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the “fast” RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL^2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL^2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL^2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Deep learning']","This paper fits into the mold of a lot of recent work on ""learning to learn"". The idea here is to use an RNN to solve tasks in an MDP, and then use a higher level RL algorithm (TRPO) to learn the parameters of this RNN. It's an interesting idea, and one that I think fits in well to a lot of current work on learning methods for optimizing policies.
 
 However, there are a few drawbacks to this paper. First, I believe that the paper is substantially lacking from the point of view of clarity, an assertion that I think is backed up by the three reviewers. Most of the methods are never formally defined, and only a high level description of the actual algorithm is provided. This was particularly confusing to me when reading through the paper, because the entire concept of the paper is suggesting that the authors are learning an RL-based policy. But it's really unclear to me why the ""fast"" RL policy should really be considered RL at all: it is just a black box policy modelled by an RNN, that the authors then argue exhibits similar behavior as RL algorithms when presented a new domain. This is perhaps a semantic point (maybe we should judge ""RL"" as virtually any algorithm that can improve over time when run in a domain), but this seems to be an odd distinction, because it certainly seems like the authors are just using TRPO to learn a policy (that happens to be in the form of an RNN). And given that plenty of existing work uses RNNs as policies (and then use an RL algorithm to tune these policies), it's unclear to me how this work differentiates itself, and why it necessitates some new conceptual approach, that specifies the policy itself as an RL algorithm (even if it acts as such in the simple bandit domain presented, for example, in the maze task it seems quite odd to cast this as anything but a policy learned for this domain).
 
 Pros:
 + Potentially nice contribution to the ""learning to learn"" field
 + Very nice experiments on the maze domain, highlighting a complex task
 
 Cons:
 - Algorithmic presentation is unclear
 - Difficult to see why this method necessitates some new conceptual framework like ""RL^2"": the authors seem to just be learning an RNN-based policy"

Examples of complex and multi-modal distributions range from topics in newswire text to conversational dialogue responses. When such latent variable models are applied to these domains, the restriction of the simple, uni-modal prior hinders the overall expressivity of the learned model as it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution. To overcome this critical restriction, we propose a flexible, simple prior distribution which can be learned efficiently and potentially capture an exponential number of modes of a target distribution. We develop the multi-modal variational encoder-decoder framework and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed prior in several natural language processing modeling tasks, including document modeling and dialogue modeling.","['Deep learning', 'Structured prediction', 'Natural language processing']","This paper explores a variational autoencoder variant.

A fundamental problem faced by object recognition systems is that
objects and their features can appear in different locations, scales
and orientations. Current deep learning methods attempt to achieve
invariance to local translations via pooling, discarding the locations
of features in the process.  Other approaches explicitly learn
transformed versions of the same feature, leading to representations
that quickly explode in size. Instead of discarding the rich and
useful information about feature transformations to achieve
invariance, we argue that models should learn object features
conjointly with their transformations to achieve equivariance.  We
propose a new model of unsupervised learning based on sparse coding
that can learn object features jointly with their affine
transformations directly from images. Results based on learning from
natural images indicate that our approach
matches the reconstruction quality of traditional sparse coding but
with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while simultaneously
learning transformations from data. These results open the door to
scaling up unsupervised learning to allow deep feature+transformation
learning in a manner consistent with the ventral+dorsal stream

Replacing linear interpolation with spherical linear interpolation prevents diverging from a model's prior distribution and produces sharper samples.

We demonstrate two new techniques for deriving attribute vectors: bias-corrected vectors with data replication and synthetic vectors with data augmentation.  Binary classification using attribute vectors is presented as a technique supporting quantitative analysis of the latent space. Most techniques are intended to be independent of model type and examples are shown on both Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.

Many of such difficulties stem from the lack of expressive power to capture the complex relations between items and users. This paper presents a new method to tackle this problem, called Collaborative Deep Embedding. In this method, a pair of dual networks, one for encoding items and the other for users, are jointly trained in a collaborative fashion. 
Particularly, both networks produce embeddings at multiple aligned levels, which, when combined together, can accurately predict the matching between items and users. Compared to existing methods, the proposed one not only provides greater expressive power to capture complex matching relations, but also generalizes better to unseen items or users. On multiple real-world datasets, this method outperforms the state of the art.",[],"The paper presents a collaborative filtering method, using dual deep nets for users and items.

In this paper, we show that learning a parameterization of ELU improves its performance. We analyzed our proposed Parametric ELU (PELU) in the context of vanishing gradients and provide a gradient-based optimization framework. We conducted several experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet with different network architectures, such as NiN, Overfeat, All-CNN and ResNet.

We also observed that Vgg using PELU tended to prefer activations saturating closer to zero, as in ReLU, except at the last layer, which saturated near -2. Finally, other presented results suggest that varying the shape of the activations during training along with the other parameters helps controlling vanishing gradients and bias shift, thus facilitating learning.",[],"The paper describes a parametric version of the exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function.

Deep learning methods that extract answers for non-factoid questions from QA sites are seen as critical since they can assist users in reaching their next decisions through conversations with AI systems. The current methods, however, have the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use of words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context (e.g. the word “relationship” has quite different meanings in the categories of Love advice and other categories). As a result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2) The current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and can not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are somewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer Construction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions (e.g. categories assigned to questions) into word embeddings while also computing them regardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the contexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of words across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2) Uses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the sentences often used to form answers (e.g. sentences representing conclusions or those supplementing the conclusions). It then simultaneously learns the optimum combination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question and those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that corresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap between answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond the current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs. Evaluations using datasets created for love advice stored in the Japanese QA site, Oshiete goo, indicate that our model achieves 20 % higher accuracy in answer creation than the strong baselines. Our model is practical and has already been applied to the love advice service in Oshiete goo.",[],"The program committee appreciates the authors' response to clarifying questions.

RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations).
Our approach associates every subtask with its own modular subpolicy,
and jointly optimizes over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across
shared subpolicies. This optimization is accomplished via a simple decoupled
actor–critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from
dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a
maze navigation game and a 2-D Minecraft-inspired crafting game. Both games
feature extremely sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a
number of high-level subgoals (e.g. escaping from a sequence of locked rooms or
collecting and combining various ingredients in the proper order). Experiments
illustrate two main advantages of our approach. First, we outperform standard
baselines that learn task-specific or shared monolithic policies. Second, our

Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art one-shot classification approaches while being much simpler and more scalable with the size of the support set. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our approach on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet datasets.

In this paper we introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model. The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and simplified the complexity of the learning problem. SoftTarget regularization proved to be an effective tool in various neural network architectures.","['Deep learning', 'Optimization', 'Computer vision']",The reviewers unanimously recommend rejection.

However, it is an inherently sequential algorithm — at each step, the processing of the current example depends on the parameters learned from the previous examples. Prior approaches to parallelizing SGD, such as Hogwild! and AllReduce, do not honor these dependences across threads and thus can potentially suffer poor convergence rates and/or poor scalability. This paper proposes SymSGD, a parallel SGD algorithm that retains the sequential semantics of SGD in expectation. Each thread in this approach learns a local model and a probabilistic model combiner that allows the local models to be combined to produce the same result as what a sequential SGD would have produced, in expectation. This SymSGD approach is applicable to any linear learner whose update rule is linear. This paper evaluates SymSGD’s accuracy and performance on 9 datasets on a shared-memory machine shows up-to 13× speedup over our heavily optimized sequential baseline on 16 cores.",[],"The reviewers largely agree that this paper is well written and presents an interesting, novel approach to parallelizing Stochastic Gradient Descent. However, the current formulation is restricted to linear regression models and requires sketching techniques to handle large number of features, although it is striking that very aggressive sketching (k~10) still works well. In this setting though, there are specialized randomized solvers such as Blendenpick (Avron et al) which sketch the data upfront to construct a high quality pre-conditioner for use with iterative methods. 
 The authors are encouraged to either compare with state of the art parallel randomized least squares solvers developed in the numerical linear algebra community (see papers by Michael Mahoney, Petros Drineas and others), or broaden the scope of the proposed methods to include models of current interest (e.g., DNNs). The latter would of course be of specific interest to the ICLR community."
409,Bk_zTU5eg,Reject,Inefficiency of stochastic gradient descent with larger mini-batches (and more learners),"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants are the most important optimization algorithms used in large scale machine learning. Mini-batch version of stochastic gradient is often used in practice for taking advantage of hardware parallelism. In this work, we analyze the effect of mini-batch size over SGD convergence for the case of general non-convex objective functions. Building on the past analyses, we justify mathematically that there can often be a large difference between the convergence guarantees provided by small and large mini-batches (given each instance processes equal number of training samples), while providing experimental evidence for the same. Going further to distributed settings, we show that an analogous effect holds with popular Asynchronous Gradient Descent (\asgd): there can be a large difference between convergence guarantees with increasing number of learners given that the cumulative number of training samples processed remains the same. Thus there is an inherent (and similar) inefficiency introduced in the convergence behavior when we attempt to take advantage of parallelism, either by increasing mini-batch size or by increase the number of learners.","['Deep learning', 'Optimization']","The work addresses the question of whether mini-batching improves the convergence of stochastic gradient methods, in terms of the number of examples, in the general non-asymptotic/non-convex setting of Ghadimi and Lan. Similar results are already known (at least as folk theory) in simpler regimes, but this result is novel. The reviewers are mixed in their opinions of the paper, but AnonReviewer4 brings up a point that deserves further attention: the analysis assumes that the same step-size is used for different mini-batch sizes. Because of this assumption, the conclusion of the paper is misleading. One of the effects of increasing the mini-batch is to decrease the variance of the estimator, which allows a larger step-size. With this larger step-size the net effect of increasing the mini-batch can actually be positive even in terms of the number of examples. Fixing the step-size removes the chance for the mini-batch strategy to do better in theory, and there is indeed a large amount of empirical evidence that mini-batches can lead to practical improvements.

Given limited resources, how does one design a network that balances its size, training time, and prediction accuracy? A surprisingly effective approach to trade accuracy for size and speed is to simply reduce the number of channels in each convolutional layer by a fixed fraction and retrain the network. In many cases this leads to significantly smaller networks with only minimal changes to accuracy. In this paper, we take a step further by empirically examining a strategy for deactivating connections between filters in convolutional layers in a way that allows us to harvest savings both in run-time and memory for many network architectures. More specifically, we generalize 2D convolution to use a channel-wise sparse connection structure and show that this leads to significantly better results than the baseline approach for large networks including VGG and Inception V3.","['Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning']","The reviewers agreed that the main contribution is the first empirical analysis on large-scale convolutional networks concerning layer-to-layer sparsity.

We first propose the idea that it is sufficient to locally carve the energy function everywhere so that its gradient points in the ""right"" direction (i.e., towards generating the data). Following on previous work on contrastive divergence, denoising autoencoders, generative stochastic networks and unsupervised learning using non-equilibrium dynamics, we propose a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the data which corresponds to a new learning procedure that first walks away from data points by following the model transition operator and then trains that operator to walk backwards for each of these steps, back towards the training example. The tightness of the variational bound relies on gradually increasing temperature as we walk away from the data, at each step providing a gradient on the parameters to maximize the probability that the transition operator returns to its previous state. Interestingly, this algorithm admits a variant where there is no explicit energy function, i.e., the parameters are used to directly define the transition operator. This also eliminates the explicit need for symmetric weights which previous Boltzmann machine or Hopfield net models require, and which makes these models less biologically plausible.",['Unsupervised Learning'],"This paper proposes an algorithm for training undirected probabilistic graphical models.

While the potential of incremental or curriculum learning to enhance learning is known, indiscriminate application of the principle does not necessarily lead to improvement, and it is essential therefore to know which forms of incremental or curriculum learning have a positive effect. This research contributes to that aim by comparing three instantiations of incremental or curriculum learning.

We introduce Incremental Sequence Learning, a simple incremental approach to sequence learning. Incremental Sequence Learning starts out by using only the first few steps of each sequence as training data. Each time a performance criterion has been reached, the length of the parts of the sequences used for training is increased.

We introduce and make available a novel sequence learning task and data set: predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences. We find that Incremental Sequence Learning greatly speeds up sequence learning and reaches the best test performance level of regular sequence learning 20 times faster, reduces the test error by 74%, and in general performs more robustly; it displays lower variance and achieves sustained progress after all three comparison methods have stopped improving. The other instantiations of curriculum learning do not result in any noticeable improvement. A trained sequence prediction model is also used in transfer learning to the task of sequence classification, where it is found that transfer learning realizes improved classification performance compared to methods that learn to classify from scratch.

With this separation of modeling from inference, inverse problems can be framed in a modular way. For example, variational inference can be applied to a broad class of models. The modularity, however, typically goes away after model parameters have been trained under a chosen inference procedure. During training, model and inference often interact in a way that the model parameters will ultimately be adapted to the chosen inference procedure, posing the two components inseparable after training. But if model and inference become inseperable after training, why separate them in the first place?

We propose a novel learning framework which abandons the dichotomy between model and inference. Instead, we introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), a class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that directly learn to solve inverse problems.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks. We show empirically that RIMs exhibit the desirable convergence behavior of classical inference procedures, and that they can outperform state-of- the-art methods when trained on specialized inference tasks.

417,BkV4VS9ll,Reject,The Incredible Shrinking Neural Network: New Perspectives on Learning Representations Through The Lens of Pruning,"How much can pruning algorithms teach us about the fundamentals of learning representations in neural networks? A lot, it turns out. Neural network model compression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general, this is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better generalization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we first reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune whole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from optimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set about testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the decisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor method based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force serial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a first-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind pruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70\% of the neurons in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and without any re-training.

The report of earlier studies has introduced a latent variable to capture the entire meaning of sentence and achieved improvement on attention-based Neural Machine Translation. We follow this approach and we believe that the capturing meaning of sentence benefits from image information because human beings understand the meaning of language not only from textual information but also from perceptual information such as that gained from vision. As described herein, we propose a neural machine translation model that introduces a continuous latent variable containing an underlying semantic extracted from texts and images.

We then propose a new group sparse convolutional neural network which could naturally learn the question representation with respect to their corresponding answers by implanting the group sparse autoencoders into the traditional convolutional neural network. The proposed model show significant improvements over strong baselines on four datasets.  ",[],"This paper proposes to use a group sparsity penalty to train an autoencoder on question answering.

Our method uses linear classifiers, referred to as ``probes'', where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given intermediate layer as discriminating features. Moreover, these probes cannot affect the training phase of a model, and they are generally added after training. They allow the user to visualize the state of the model at multiple steps of training. We demonstrate how this can be used to develop a better intuition about models and to diagnose potential problems.",[],"The reviewers generally agreed that the research direction pursued in the paper is a valuable one, but all reviewers expressed strong reservations about the value of a linear probe on intermediate features.

Our models under both architectures jointly capture the notions of salience and redundancy of sentences. In addition, these models have the advantage of being very interpretable, since they allow visualization of their predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and redundancy.

Rather than studying this as a black-box discrete regression problem with no assumption whatsoever

This principle creates a powerful inductive bias that we exploit with neural architectures that are defined recursively, by learning two scale-invariant atomic operators: how to split a given input into two disjoint sets, and how to merge two partially solved tasks into a larger partial solution. The scale invariance creates parameter sharing across all stages of the architecture, and the dynamic design creates architectures whose complexity can be tuned in a differentiable manner.

As a result, our model is trained by backpropagation not only to minimize the errors at the output, but also to do so as efficiently as possible, by enforcing shallower computation graphs. Moreover, thanks to the scale invariance, the model can be trained only with only input/output pairs, removing the need to know oracle intermediate split and merge decisions.

We build on recent results in handwriting prediction developed by Graves (2013), and we focus on generating sequences that possess the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting and calligraphic art forms. Rather than model raw sequence data, we first preprocess and reconstruct the input training data with a concise representation given by a motor plan (in the form of a coarse sequence of `ballistic' targets) and corresponding dynamic parameters (which define the velocity and curvature of the pen-tip trajectory).

In this paper, we make the first attempt at building the phylogenetic tree diagram by leveraging the high-level features learned by deep neural networks. Our method is based on the intuition that if two species share similar features, then their cross activations in the softmax layer should be high. Based on the deep representation of convolutional neural networks trained for image classification, we build a tree of life for species in the image categories of ImageNet. Further, for species not in the ImageNet categories that are visually similar to some category, the cosine similarity of their activation vectors in the same layer should be high. By applying the inner product similarity of the activation vectors at the last fully connected layer for different species, we can roughly build their tree of life.

However, this is not computationally scalable for applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories. On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory.

By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML.",[],"This paper is well motivated and clearly written, and is representative of the rapidly growing interdisciplinary area of hardware-software co-design for handling large-scale Machine Learning workloads. In particular, the paper develops a detailed simulator of SSDs with onboard multicore processors so that ML computations can be done near where the data resides.
 
 Reviewers are however unanimously unconvinced about the potential impact of the simulator, and more broadly the relevance to ICLR. The empirical section of the paper is largely focused on benchmarking logistic regression models on MNIST, which reviewers find underwhelming. It is conceivable that the results reflect performance on real hardware, but the ICLR community would atleast expect to see realistic deep learning workloads on larger datasets such as Imagenet, where scalability challenges have been throughly studied.

We assume that the input $x$ follow Gaussian distribution. The network is trained using gradient descent to mimic the output of a teacher network of the same size with fixed parameters $w*$ using $l_2$ loss. We first show that when $K = 1$, the nonlinear dynamics can be written in close form, and converges to $w*$ with at least $(1-\epsilon)/2$ probability, if random weight initializations of proper standard derivation ($\sim 1/\sqrt{d}$) is used, verifying empirical practice. For networks with many ReLU nodes ($K \ge 2$), we apply our close form dynamics and prove that when the teacher parameters $\{w*_j\}_{j=1}^K$ forms orthonormal bases, (1) a symmetric weight initialization yields a convergence to a saddle point and (2) a certain symmetry-breaking weight initialization yields global convergence to $w*$ without local minima. To our knowledge, this is the first proof that shows global convergence in nonlinear neural network without unrealistic assumptions on the independence of ReLU activations. In addition, we also give a concise gradient update formulation for a multilayer ReLU network when it follows a teacher of the same size with $l_2$ loss.

However, these sparsity-centric optimization techniques might be less effective for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially for the training phase, because of the significant structural difference between the neurons. To investigate if there is possible sparsity-centric optimization for training LSTM-based RNNs, we studied several applications and observed that there is potential sparsity in the gradients generated in the backward propagation. In this paper, we illustrate why the sparsity exists and propose a simple yet effective thresholding technique to induce further more sparsity during training an LSTM-based RNN training. Experiment results show that the proposed technique can increase the sparsity of linear gate gradients to higher than 80\% without loss of performance, which makes more than 50\% multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations redundant in an entire LSTM training process. These redudant MAC operations can be eliminated by hardware techniques to improve the energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM-based RNNs.","['Optimization', 'Deep learning']","The main point of the paper was that sparsifying gradients does not hurt performance; however, this in itself is not enough for a publication in this venue.

In this work, we propose a weakly supervised inversion machine trained to generate similar imaginations that when rendered using differentiable, graphics-like decoders, produce the original visual input. We constrain the imagination spaces by providing exemplar memory repositories in the form of foreground segmented objects, albedo, shading, background scenes and imposing adversarial losses on the imagination spaces. Our model learns to perform such inversion with weak supervision, without ever having seen paired annotated data, that is, without having seen the image paired with the corresponding ground-truth imaginations. We demonstrate our method by applying it to three  Computer Vision tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic decomposition and object segmentation, each task having its own differentiable renderer.  Data driven adversarial imagination priors  effectively guide inversion,  minimize the need for hand designed priors of smoothness or good continuation, or the need for paired annotated data.","['Unsupervised Learning', 'Deep learning']",All three reviewers point to significant deficiencies (particularly the lack of quantitative evaluation and clarity problems).

442,ry7O1ssex,Reject,Generative Adversarial Networks as Variational Training of Energy Based Models,"In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised learning. We propose VGAN, which works by minimizing a variational lower bound of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of an energy based model (EBM), where the model density $p(\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a variational distribution $q(\mathbf{x})$ that is easy to sample from. The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\mathbf{x})$, $q(\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable solutions.",[],"This paper is timely since it addresses the connections between energy-based models, GANS, and the general space of generative models. The two principal concerns about the paper are: lack of clarity and coherence in the paper; inability to effectively judge the effectiveness of the method. The responses of the authors address these concern to some extent, but these concerns remain. The paper will have much higher-impact after further introspection, but at present, the paper is not yet ready for acceptance at the conference."

A prominent approach is to apply variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a classical method seeking correlated components between views. The basic CCA is restricted to maximizing a simple dependency criterion, correlation, measured directly between data coordinates. We introduce a new method that finds dependent subspaces of views directly optimized for the data analysis task of neighbor retrieval between multiple views. We optimize mappings for each view such as linear transformations to maximize cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples. The criterion arises directly from the well-defined retrieval task, detects nonlinear and local similarities, measures dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data coordinates, and is related to well understood measures of information retrieval quality. In experiments the proposed method outperforms alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities, and yields insights into local dependencies between multiple views.",['Unsupervised Learning'],"The reviewers agree that there are issues in the paper (in particular, the weakness of the experimental part), and that it is not ready for publication."

computation of the CCA projection matrices, and free choice of the final 
optimization target. We show the effectiveness of this approach in 
cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text

freely-learned projections. We assume that Differentiable CCA could be a 
useful building block for many multi-modality tasks.",['Multi-modal learning'],"The authors propose to use CCA as a transformation within a network that optimally correlates two views.

In order to enable a fair comparison between different video frame prediction models, we also propose a new evaluation protocol. We use generated frames as input to a classifier trained with ground truth sequences. This criterion guarantees that models scoring high are those producing sequences which preserve discrim- inative features, as opposed to merely penalizing any deviation, plausible or not, from the ground truth. Our proposed approach compares favourably against more sophisticated ones on the UCF-101 data set, while also being more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and computational cost.","['Computer vision', 'Unsupervised Learning']","There were serious concerns raised about the originality of the work in regard to prior methods.

This approach provides maximal theoretical equivalence to the de facto gradient descent algorithm, requires limited asynchronicity across multiple iterations of gradient descent, theoretically improves overall speedup, while minimizing the additional space requirements for asynchronicity.

On several benchmark datasets, HFH demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy.

when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the
TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer)
network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a
deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model.

The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable
and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model
follows the deep networks community design, i.e.,  the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily
understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model when tackling the problem of classification with missing data, leveraging TMMs unique ability of
tractable marginalization which leads to optimal classifiers regardless of the missingness distribution.","['Deep learning', 'Supervised Learning', 'Unsupervised Learning']","The authors have recently made several connections between deep learning and tensor algebra.

This may result in the whole training process (initialization/pre-training + fine-tuning) to be very time consuming. In this paper, we combine the ideas of ensemble learning and deep learning, and present a novel deep learning framework called deep error-correcting output codes (DeepECOC). DeepECOC are composed of multiple layers of the ECOC module, which combines multiple binary classifiers for feature learning. Here, the weights learned for the binary classifiers can be considered as weights between two successive layers, while the outputs of the combined binary classifiers as the outputs of a hidden layer. On the one hand, the ECOC modules can be learned using given supervisory information, and on the other hand, based on the ternary coding design, the weights can be learned only using part of the training data. Hence, the supervised pre-training of DeepECOC is in general very effective and efficient. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare DeepECOC with traditional ECOC, feature learning and deep learning algorithms on several benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that DeepECOC perform not only better than traditional ECOC and feature learning algorithms, but also state-of the-art deep learning models in most cases.

However, to obtain good results, most of the previous deep models need a large number of training data. In this paper, for small and middle scale applications, we
propose a novel deep learning framework based on stacked feature learning models. Particularly, we stack marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) layer by layer for the initialization of the deep architecture and call it “Marginal Deep Architectures” (MDA). In the implementation of MDA, the weight matrices of MFA are first learned layer by layer, and then we exploit some deep learning techniques, such as back propagation, dropout and denoising to fine tune the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of MDA, we have compared it with some feature learning methods and deep learning models on 7 small and middle scale real-world applications, including handwritten digits recognition, speech recognition, historical document understanding, image classification, action recognition and so on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDA performs not only better than shallow feature learning models, but also state-of-the-art deep learning models in these applications.",[],The reviewers unanimously recommend rejection.

However, an inherent limitation of Paragraph Vector is lack of ability to infer distributed representations for texts outside of the training set. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Generative Paragraph Vector, which can be viewed as a probabilistic extension of the Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector with a complete generative process. With the ability to infer the distributed representations for unseen texts, we can further incorporate text labels into the model and turn it into a supervised version, namely Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector. In this way, we can leverage the labels paired with the texts to guide the representation learning, and employ the learned model for prediction tasks directly. Experiments on five text classification benchmark collections show that both model architectures can yield superior classification performance over the state-of-the-art counterparts.

It is not accurate, they also used gradient descent at test time.

However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world.

In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our first attack is based on a simple idea of adding perturbation to a randomly selected single pixel or a small set of them. We then improve the effectiveness of this attack by carefully constructing a small set of pixels to perturb by using the idea of greedy local-search. Our proposed attacks also naturally extend to a stronger notion of misclassification. Our extensive experimental results illustrate that even these elementary attacks can reveal a deep neural network's vulnerabilities. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test while designing robust networks.

472,r1br_2Kge,Invite to Workshop Track,Short and Deep: Sketching and Neural Networks,"Data-independent methods for dimensionality reduction such as random projections, sketches, and feature hashing have become increasingly popular in recent years.  These methods often seek to reduce dimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class, resulting in inherent lower bounds on the size of projected data.  For example, preserving linear separability requires $\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ dimensions, where $\gamma$ is the margin, and in the case of polynomial functions, the number of required dimensions has an exponential dependence on the polynomial degree.
                                                                                                                                                            
Despite these limitations, we show that the dimensionality can be reduced further while maintaining performance guarantees, using improper learning with a slightly larger hypothesis class. In particular, we show that any sparse polynomial function of a sparse binary vector can be computed from a compact sketch by a single-layer neural network, where the sketch size has a logarithmic dependence on the polynomial degree.
                                                                                                                                                           
A practical consequence is that networks trained on sketched data are compact, and therefore suitable for settings with memory and power constraints. We empirically show that our approach leads to networks with fewer parameters than related methods such as feature hashing, at equal or better performance.",['Theory'],"The reviewers present a detailed set of concerns regarding the paper. In particular, the paper lacks comparison to other sketching works. The sketches used in the paper are rudimentary and in practice, there are more sophisticated sketches employed.
 
 Sketching has a different goal from function approximation. Sketching aims to reconstruct (with a certain error). The paper uses sketching in a naive manner, in the sense that the error due to the sketch is incorporated into the overall error. But presumably, networks can be compressed without achieving reconstruction on each instance, while maintaining a guarantee on the overall accuracy. I would find such a framework to be more interesting and practically relevant.
 
 On the other hand, it is important for the ICLR community to be exposed to sketching frameworks. Hence, I would like to invite the paper to be presented in the workshop, in the hope that it can spur further ideas."

In Cat2Vec, a low-dimensional continuous vector is automatically learned for each category in each field. The interactions among inter-field categories are further explored by different neural gates and the most informative ones are selected by pooling layers. In our experiments, with the exploration of the interactions between pairwise categories over layers, the model attains great improvement over state-of-the-art models in a supervised learning task, e.g., click prediction, while capturing the most significant interactions from the data.

However, robust concepts often have small neural networks in practice. We show an efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem on the boolean hypercube in this context.

We prove that any noise-stable boolean function on n boolean-valued input variables can be well-approximated by a two-layer linear threshold circuit with a small number of hidden-layer nodes and small weights, that depend only on the noise-stability and approximation parameters, and are independent of n. We also give a polynomial time learning algorithm that outputs a small two-layer linear threshold circuit that approximates such a given function. We also show weaker generalizations of this to noise-stable polynomial threshold functions and noise-stable boolean functions in general.",['Theory'],"The paper makes a solid technical contribution in establishing a universal approximation theorem for the boolean hypercube. They characterize the class of boolean functions that can be efficiently approximated by a two-layer network.
 
 We like the idea of noise stability, and it could explain why in practice, perturbation techniques such as dropout are effective. Moreover, humans can identify images, despite corruptions, and hence, intuitively the concepts we aim to learn should be robust.
 
 However, the framework of the paper deviated from the networks and data structures that are the norm in practice. In practice, we rarely have boolean functions. And it is well known that boolean functions can behave quite differently from continuous functions. 
 
 We recommend that the authors widen the scope of their work, and attempt to connect their findings to practical networks and functions. Moreover, we recommend that they do a more thorough literature survey. For instance, the idea of robust concepts has appeared before

artificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity
transformation. This idea not only motivated various normalization techniques,

In this work, we put the principle of identity parameterization on a more 
solid theoretical footing alongside further empirical progress. We first

their standard parameterization is substantially more delicate.  Second, we

expressivity in the sense that the network can represent any function of its
sample provided that the model has more parameters than the sample size.

Directly inspired by our theory, we experiment with a radically simple
residual architecture consisting of only residual convolutional layers and
ReLu activations, but no batch normalization, dropout, or max pool. Our model
improves significantly on previous all-convolutional networks on the CIFAR10,
CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification benchmarks.

They then extend to non-linear resnets with ReLU units and demonstrate that they have finite sample expressivity. They formally establish these results. Inspired by their theory, they perform experiments using simpler architectures without any batch norm, dropout or other regularizations and fix the last layer and still attain competitive results. Indeed, they admit that data augmentation is a form of regularization and can replace other regularization schemes.

For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters.

In this work, we introduce a novel non-linear dimensionality regularization technique for solving such problems without pre-training.
We re-formulate Kernel-PCA as an energy minimization problem in which low dimensionality constraints are introduced as regularization terms in the energy.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to create a dimensionality regularizer in the KPCA framework. Our approach relies on robustly penalizing the rank of the recovered factors directly in the implicit feature space to create
their low-dimensional approximations in closed form. Our approach performs robust KPCA in the presence of missing data and noise.

478,SygvTcYee,Reject,"ParMAC: distributed optimisation of nested functions, with application to binary autoencoders","Many powerful machine learning models are based on the composition of multiple processing layers, such as deep nets, which gives rise to nonconvex objective functions. A general, recent approach to optimise such ""nested"" functions is the ""method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC)"". MAC introduces an auxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model into independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that alternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has the advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces parallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with nondifferentiable layers. We describe ParMAC, a distributed-computation model for MAC. This trains on a dataset distributed across machines while limiting the amount of communication so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. ParMAC works on a cluster of machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until convergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic updates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines. ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing. We study the convergence of ParMAC and its parallel speedup, and implement ParMAC using MPI to learn binary autoencoders for fast image retrieval, achieving nearly perfect speedups in a 128-processor cluster with a training set of 100 million high-dimensional points.
","['Optimization', 'Deep learning']","The work proposes a parallel/distributed variant of the MAC decomposition method. In presents some theoretical and experimental results supporting the parallelization strategy. The reviews are mixed and indeed a common concern among the reviewers was the choice of test problem. To me it is ok to only concentrate on a single class of problems, but in this case it needs to be a problem that the ICLR community identifies as being of central importance. Otherwise, if a more esoteric problem is chosen then I (and the reviewers) would rather see that the method is useful on multiple problems. Otherwise, it's basically impossible to extrapolate the experiments to new settings and we are forced to re-implement the algorithm. I'm not saying that the authors necessarily need to consider deep networks and there are many alternative possible models (sparse coding, collaborative filtering, etc.). But it should be noted that, without further experimental comparisons, it is impossible to verify the author's claims that the method is effective for deeply-nested models.
 
 Other concerns brought up by the reviewers (beyond the clarity/presentation issues, which should also be addressed): the experimental comparison would be more convincing with a comparison to an existing approach like a parallel SGD method. I appreciate that the authors have done a lot of work already on this problem, but doing such obvious comparisons should be the job of the author instead of the reader (focusing purely on parallelization would be ok if the MAC model was extremely-widely-used already and parallelizing was an open problem, but my impression is that this is not the case). As a minor aside, the memory issue will be more serious for deeply-nested models, due to the use of the decomposition approach (we don't want to store the activations for all layers for all examples), and this doesn't arise in SGD."

In contrast, most deep learning architectures deploy computational resources homogeneously to every part of the visual input. Is such a prodigal deployment of resources necessary? In this paper, we present a framework for investigating the extent to which connectionist architectures can perceive an image in full detail even when presented with low acuity, distorted input. Our goal is to initiate investigations that will be fruitful both for engineering better networks and also for eventually testing hypotheses on the neural mechanisms responsible for our own visual system's ability to perceive missing information. We find that networks can compensate for low acuity input by learning global feature functions that allow the network to fill in some of the missing details. For example, the networks accurately perceive shape and color in the periphery, even when 75\% of the input is achromatic and low resolution. On the other hand, the network is prone to similar mistakes as humans; for example, when presented with a fully grayscale landscape image, it perceives the sky as blue when the sky is actually a red sunset.

Unlike previous methods which factorize a weight matrix into multiple real-valued matrices, our method factorizes both weights and activations into integer and noninteger components. In our method, the real-valued weight matrix is approximated by a multiplication of a ternary matrix and a real-valued co-efficient matrix. Since the ternary matrix consists of three integer values, {-1, 0, +1}, it only consumes 2 bits per element. At test-time, an activation vector that passed from a previous layer is also transformed into a weighted sum of binary vectors, {-1, +1}, which enables fast feed-forward propagation based on simple logical operations: AND, XOR, and bit count. This makes it easier to deploy a deep network on low-power CPUs or to design specialized hardware.
In our experiments, we tested our method on three different networks: a CNN for handwritten digits, VGG-16 model for ImageNet classification, and VGG-Face for large-scale face recognition. In particular, when we applied our method to three fully connected layers in the VGG-16, 15x acceleration and memory compression up to 5.2% were achieved with only a 1.43% increase in the top-5 error.

Biclustering has several noteworthy applications and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems, respectively.

FABIA is one of the most successful biclustering methods and is used by companies like Bayer, Janssen, or Zalando. FABIA is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated. Sample membership is difficult to determine because vectors do not have exact zero entries and can have both large positive and large negative values.

We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.

On 400 benchmark datasets with artificially implanted biclusters, RFN significantly outperformed 13 other biclustering competitors including FABIA. In biclustering experiments on three gene expression datasets with known clusters that were determined by separate measurements, RFN biclustering was two times significantly better than the other 13 methods and once on second place. On data of the 1000 Genomes Project, RFN could identify DNA segments which indicate, that interbreeding with other hominins starting already before ancestors of modern humans left Africa.","['Deep learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Applications']","The reviewers pointed out several issues with the paper, and all recommended rejection."

487,rJXTf9Bxg,Reject,Conditional Image Synthesis With Auxiliary Classifier GANs,"Synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images has been a long-standing challenge in machine learning. In this paper we introduce new methods for the improved training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis. We construct a variant of GANs employing label conditioning that results in 128x128 resolution image samples exhibiting global coherence. We expand on previous work for image quality assessment to provide two new analyses for assessing the discriminability and diversity of samples from class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate that high resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, 128x128 samples are more than twice as discriminable as artificially resized 32x32 samples. In addition, 84.7% of the classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real ImageNet data.",['Deep learning'],"Ratings summary:

 Clear easy to read paper focusing on generating higher quality higher resolution (128x128) pixel imagery with GANs. There were broad concerns however across reviewers that the work is lacking in clearly identifiable novelty. The authorÕs point to a list of novel elements of the work in their rebuttal. However, the most negative reviewer also has issues with the evaluation metrics used.
 
 Thus, unfortunately, the PCs believe that this work isn't ready to appear at the conference."
488,S1HEBe_Jl,Reject,Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography,"We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect
information from other neural networks.  Specifically, we focus on
ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we
specify those properties in terms of an adversary.  Thus, a
system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim
to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from
eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob.
We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks;
instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially.
We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn 
how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also
how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet
confidentiality goals.

489,S1J0E-71l,Reject,Surprisal-Driven Feedback in Recurrent Networks,"Recurrent neural nets are widely used for predicting temporal data. Their inherent deep feedforward structure allows learning complex sequential patterns. It is believed that top-down feedback might be an important missing ingredient which in theory could help disambiguate similar patterns depending on broader context. In this paper, we introduce surprisal-driven recurrent networks, which take into account past error information when making new predictions. This is achieved by continuously monitoring the discrepancy between most recent predictions and the actual observations. Furthermore, we show that it outperforms other stochastic and fully deterministic approaches on enwik8 character level prediction task achieving 1.37 BPC.","['Unsupervised Learning', 'Applications', 'Deep learning']","Based on the feedback, I'm going to be rejecting the paper on the following grounds:
 1. Results are not SOTA as reported.
 2. No real experiments other than cursory experiments on Hutter prize data.
 2. Writing is very poor.
 
 However, just for playing devil's advocate, to the reviewers, I would like to point out that I am in agreement with the author that dynamic evaluation is not equivalent to this method. The weights are not changed in this model, as far as I can see, for the test set. Surprisal is just an extra input to the model. I think the reviewers were puzzled by the fact that at test time, the actual sequence needs to be known. While this may be problematic for generative modeling, I do not see why this would be a problem for language modeling, where the goal of the model is only to provide a log prob to evaluate how good a sequence of text is. Long before language modeling started being used to generate text, this was the main reason to use it - in speech recognition, spelling correction etc.."
